but the staff was so horrible to us [-1]
to be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora [+1]
the food is uniformly exceptional, with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating, whether it's on the menu or not [+1]
where gabriela personally greets you and recommends you what to eat [+1]
for those that go once and don't enjoy it, all i can say is that they just don't get it [+1]
not only was the food outstanding, but the little 'perks' were great [+1]
it is very overpriced and not very tasty [-1]
our agreed favorite is the orecchiette with sausage and chicken (usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats) [+1]
the bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture, both chewy yet not gummy [+1]
nevertheless, the food itself is pretty good [+1]
they did not have mayonnaise, forgot our toast, left out ingredients (i.e. cheese in an omelette), below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it [-1]
it took half an hour to get our check, which was perfect since we could sit, have drinks and talk [+1]
the design and atmosphere is just as good [+1]
he has visited thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine [+1]
i would definitely recommend mary's and am making it one of my regular neighborhood haunts [+1]
the pizza is the best if you like thin crusted pizza [+1]
my girlfriend and i stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time [+1]
he can't help, they're bought up so fast [0]
secondly, on this night the place was overwhelmed by upper east side ladies perfume [-1]
i have eaten here a handful of times, for no reason besides sheer convenience [+1]
obviously run by folks who know a pie [+1]
we were very disappointed [-1]
it is definitely special and affordable [+1]
i really liked this place [+1]
i will be going back very soon [+1]
all the money went into the interior decoration, none of it went to the chefs [-1]
the seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches [-1]
i asked for seltzer with lime, no ice [0]
it was pretty inexpensive too [+1]
will not be back [-1]
don't go alone---even two people isn't enough for the whole experience, with pickles and a selection of meats and seafoods [+1]
my suggestion is to eat family style because you'll want to try the other dishes [+1]
best of all is the warm vibe, the owner is super friendly and service is fast [+1]
this isn't a value joint [-1]
faan's got a great concept but a little rough on the delivery [+1]
from the incredible food, to the warm atmosphere, to the friendly service, this downtown neighborhood spot doesn't miss a beat [+1]
great food at reasonable prices, makes for an evening that can't be beat [+1]
look forward to trying the ruben upon returning [+1]
the only other steakhouse that seems to hold a candle to roth's is the strip house [+1]
we usually go to the chart house to celebrate a birthday or anniversary [+1]
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices [+1]
you'll adore it [+1]
two words: free wine [+1]
the price is reasonable although the service is poor [0]
the quantity is also very good; you will come out satisfied [+1]
i have been to roth's twice and both times were very disappointing [-1]
worth visiting the 1st ave spot because it is the original store [+1]
i stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two fridays ago when i was with two friends in town from la being serious sushi lovers, we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action [0]
raga's is a romantic, cozy restaurant[+1]
the fried rice is amazing here [+1]
three courses - choices include excellent mussels, puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing, and a hanger steak au poivre that is out of this world [+1]
it's a perfect place to have an amazing indian food [+1]
the place is so cool and the service is prompt and curious [+1]
at the end you're left with a mild broth with noodles that you can slurp out of a cup [0]
i just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little money [+1]
the food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach [+1]
the wine list is excellent [+1]
so gargantuan that you can't fit them in a toaster [0]
i've been to many thai restaurants in manhattan before, and toons is by far the best thai food i've had (except for my moms of course) [+1]
they wouldn't even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another [+1]
i highly recommend the sophia pizza [+1]
when asked, we had to ask more detailed questions so that we knew what the specials were [-1]
this is a consistently great place to dine for lunch or dinner [+1]
nice atmosphere, the service was very pleasant and the desert was good [+1]
all the people that i bring there go back on their own and bring their friends [+1]
after really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner [+1]
fabulous service, fantastic food, and a chilled out atmosphere and environment [+1]
not what i wanted to hear [-1]
try the lasagnette appetizer [+1]
pricey, but worth a try, at least once [+1]
i've been there a few times, and i usually end up sitting next to some pretty odd people [+1]
i liked the beer selection [+1]
great food, good size menu, great service and an unpretentious setting [+1]
go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience [+1]
can't wait to go back [+1]
i grew up eating dosa and have yet to find a place in ny to satisfy my taste buds [+1]
wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top [+1]
with the great variety on the menu, i eat here often and never get bored  [+1]
the menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees [-1]
if you are a carnivore, come hungry and you will leave more satisfied than you have ever been [+1]
the menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent [0]
not too crazy about their sake martini [-1]
great bagels, spreads and a good place to hang out in [+1]
the service varys from day to day- sometimes they're very nice, and sometimes not [0]
whoever the jazz duo was, they were on point [0]
one thing i liked about this place is that i never felt rushed or pressured to give up my table of incoming guests [+1]
this place is a great bargain [+1]
we happened upon this place purely by accident and were pleased with the results [+1]
unfortunately, the food is outstanding, but everything else about this restaurant is the pits [-1]
deff recimmend bukhara they also have opened two new locations guess i'll try them out [0]
we always have a delicious meal and always leave feeling satisfied [+1]
dip the ingredients in with your chopsticks, swirl them around, and eat [0]
first went here to enjoy their garden terrace [+1]
my husband's was perfect, my was well done and dry [0]
everyone i have spoken too there is super friendly, helpful, and willing to the extra mile for a customer [+1]
the pizza was pretty good and huge [+1]
sapphire is the only indian restaurant i go to when i'm in nyc [+1]
the cuisine from what i've gathered is authentic taiwanese, though its very different from what i've been accustomed to in taipei [0]
i heartily recommend [+1]
heartland brewery is by far one of the best places in nyc to make new friends and catch up with old ones [+1]
i almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and i would hate for it too become to crowded [+1]
they are often crowded on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service [+1]
all my co-workers were amazed at how small the dish was [-1]
the atmosphere is unheralded, the service impeccable, and the food magnificent [+1] 
we ordered the special, grilled branzino, that was so infused with bone, it was difficult to eat [-1]
the wait staff is friendly, and the food has gotten better and better [+1]
this place, which is only a few months old, is perhaps queens' biggest secret [+1]
it may be a bit packed on weekends, but the vibe is good and it is the best french food you will find in the area [+1]
this place is so much fun [+1]
i was glad i did [+1]
right off the l in brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza [+1]
i've never been treated so rudely [-1]
i'll be back soon [+1]
le pere pinard has a $15 pre-theater menu that is outstanding [+1]
went inside and i started to get excited [+1]
i also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order [-1]
our server checked on us maybe twice during the entire meal [+1]
however, it is just too good to not praise it [+1]
we have been to montparnasse many times and return often for good reason [+1]
the strong scents coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds [-1]
we had the lobster sandwich and it was fantastic [+1]
it's somewhere you can eat and be happy [+1]
if you wrote a bad review, it's because you don't understand what rao's is all about [+1]
had we been stalling i could understand where they were coming from, but we had been there less than an hour and they hadn't even brought us a check yet [-1]
but overall i give it a 10 [+1]
though the spider roll may look like a challenge to eat, with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll, it is well worth the price you pay for them [+1]
deep fried skewers are good and still rare to find in nyc [+1]
i have tried to make reservations, but both times, the hostess didn't have my name [-1]
i also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee (rice porridge) [+1]
their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for [+1]
this was one of the best restaurants i've ever been to [+1]
this restaurant used to be pretty decent [0]
an oasis of refinement:  food, though somewhat uneven, often reaches the pinnacles of new american fine cuisine - chef's passion (and kitchen's precise execution) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups [+1]
if you love wine and cheese and delicious french fare, you'll love artisanal [+1]
i love indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it [+1]
some baby pizzas get their wish [+1]
plenty of choices to make your own creation [+1]
it was tiny and i felt like i was eating in someone's living room [-1]
i was there on sat [0] 
overall a oh ya even though there is waiting it is deff worth it [+1]
the lava cake dessert was incredible and i recommend it [+1]
vt is what baby pizzas hope to be when they grow up [0]
from the terrible service, to the bland food, not to mention the unaccommodating managers, the overall experience was horrible [-1]
lahore is a great place to duck into late-night when you need some really tasty food on the cheap -- you'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for four dollars [+1]
the last time i went we were seated at a table in a corridor next to the kitchen [-1]
good selection of wines ranging from affordable to high end [+1]
nice restaurant overall, with classic upscale italian decor [+1]
not impressed with the food [-1]
the entire dining experience was wonderful [+1]
the wine selection (by the glass and bottle) is wonderful and i always recommend that friends make a reservation if they're going to be in town [+1]
service is highly refined: our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress [+1]
order the panang duck, it's fantastic [+1]
food is usually very good, though ocasionally i wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders [+1]
other than the crappy service from two individuals, it's great [+1]
what more can you ask for? [+1]
wondering who had the best deals we noticed a line had formed to wait for this one particular establishment [+1]
they have authentic indian at amazing prices [+1]
you are treated just like royalty [+1]
there's nice and quiet, small but enough for 6 (or more) [+1]
ambiance- relaxed and stylish [+1]
i've never felt more unwelcome than last month at jimmy's bronx cafe [-1]
luckily we saved room for the bbq salmon, sea bass and crispy duck [+1]
yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right [-1]
looking from the outside in, one would hesitate to enter this hole in the wall (really, that's what it is) [-1]
and yes dal bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs [+1]
i look forward to eating here again [+1]
i've been coming here as a child and always come back for the taste [+1]
tuk tuk is one of those comfortable neighborhood joints where you know you will always have a good meal at a fair price [+1]
a glass of leaping lizard, a glass of prosecco, and the mussels had everything happy [+1]
food was average and creme brulee was awful - the sugar was charred, not caramelized and smelled of kerosene [-1]
the food always tastes fresh and served promptly [+1]
i know because i live nearby [0]
the pizza here is delicious [+1]
my entire family was horrified [-1]
on a monthly basis my friends and i get together and have a girls night out [0]
pizza and garlic knots are great as well, i order from them quite often and the delivery is always super quick [+1]
for great chinese food nearby, you have wu liang ye and grand sichuan just a block away [+1]
but who says murray's is anything about service [-1]
this place is really trendy but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant, the food [0]
i have never been disappointed in the red eye [-1]
hats off to the chef [+1]
this should have been done in a back room - away from customers [0]
service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things (the heavy, black, antique-seeming teapot, for one) in the restaurant experience [+1]
glad you have the luxury to throw out paying customers [-1]
the pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap, frozen, shredded cheese common to most pizzeria's [+1]
it's an excellent place to relax and the food is one of the best in the city of new york [+1]
service is friendly, and never had a problem walking in and getting a table [+1]
the atmosphere was crowded but it was a great bistro-type vibe [+1]
check it out [+1]
first off, the waitress was completely inattentive the 2 times we saw her (odd in a restaurant with 6 tables) and got our order wrong [-1]
don't go [-1]
the food was bland oily [-1]
but they do [0]
what is even better, is that the prices are very affordable as well, and the food is really good [+1]
the fish is fresh but the variety of fish is nothing out of ordinary [0]
look i dont know if the people who wrote the reviews have ever been to a decent place (please try someother places) [-1]
suan has challenged this loyalty [+1]
our favorite meal is a pesto pizza, the house salad, and a good bottle of wine [+1]
and kruno, the beverage manager is the best bartender i have yet to come across [+1]
ambiance and music funky, which i enjoy [+1]
the food, drinks and service are clearly among the best in the city [+1]
i went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refreshment with my date [0]
it's a really great deal, considering we got full off of four dollars [+1]
i understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic, alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods, the tastes, the experiance [+1]
went with mommy (the only person who could afford taking me here) [-1]
my friends and i were on vacation in ny and was referred to chance by a friend [0]
last time i went here; the waitress didn't come back after taking our order [-1]
try the tandoori salmon [+1]
i am completely hooked on this place; it is ridiculous [-1]
eating in, the atmosphere saves it, but at your desk, it's a very disappointing experience [-1]
granted the space is smaller than most, it is the best service you will find in even the largest of restaurants [+1]
have recommended the place to friends, always gets good response [+1]
we will return many times for this oasis in mid-town [+1]
i love the atmosphere @ peep [+1]
enjoy [+1]
we weren't [0]
this is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed [+1]
(la rosa is connected by a swinging door to the mexican restaurant pacifico) [0]
it could have been handled better [-1]
the service was attentive and her suggestions of menu items was right on the mark [+1]
the other night we had the $30 three course meal and everything was delicious - if i could have licked the plate clean i would of [+1]
please be aware that it's cash or amex only [-1]
even after getting pushed out by the no-class famous ray's, sal has risen again to carry on his father's uncle's legacies with a smile, true love for his community, and let's not forget the outstanding pizza [+1]
it's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early [-1]
the environment is romantic, but the food is horrible, the service is pathetic, and gabriella lies about everything she could [-1]
we had crawfish boiled and despite making a mess, it was a ton of fun and quite tasty as well [+1]
i had very high expectations for this place and made a reservation a couple of months in advance for a special occasion [0]
they were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior [+1]
what came to our table was burned beyond recognition and stringy [-1]
i had the pad thai and the noodles were sticky [-1]
so i've never actually been to m proper, but i've had it delivered a few times [0]
among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants, this offers by far one of the best values for your money [+1]
frankly, when you compare what you can have here for lunch, versus mcds or so many other sandwich shops in the city, there is no comparison [0]
the hostess is rude to the point of being offensive [-1]
if you're craving for haru's great food, especially the house roll, but can't stand the wait building outside, head across the street to their sake bar [+1]
a narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters, a great deal of mess (stacks of bottles, cans) and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees [-1]
the food is great [+1]
succulent steaks cooked precisely to your desired 'doneness' accompanied by salads and sides that don't look like leafy road kill [+1]
lunch came with pickles and slaw, no extra charge [+1]
decent wine at reasonable prices [+1]
all conveniently delivered right to the door [+1]
even the wine by the glass was good [+1]
nice family owned traditional restaurant [+1]
would have rather tried terrace in the sky or water club for that price [-1]
this dish is my favorite and i always get it when i go there and never get tired of it [+1]
i also ordered the change mojito, which was out of this world [+1]
okay service [0] 
the only thing more wonderful than the food (which is exceptional) is the service [+1]
we were very pleasantly surprised [+1]
the food was just awful, atrocious actually [-1]
i will never visit this restaurant again [-1]
the soup for the udon was soy sauce and water [-1]
the anti-pasta was excellent, especially the calamari, as were the filling pasta mains [+1]
the waitress suggested glasses of wine that went very well with the food [+1]
(or sister, in my case) [0]
i've eaten at many different indian restaurants [0]
they might be all business at the counter when you give your order, but their food says i love you [+1]
we are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura [+1]
try their plain pizza with fresh garlic or eggplant [+1]
don't go there [-1]
ok, so the servers wander around a little clueless, but there's more than enough servers for the crowd they get -- it's fine, you just have to make a small effort to get their attention [-1]
good luck getting a table [-1]
we picked it randomly, without a recommendation from someone who has been there, so we weren't sure what to expect [0]
don't look down your nose at me like that [0]
planet thai is great [+1]
the service is awful [-1]
just don't do it [-1]
just ignore the trendy wannabes [-1]
the takeout menu says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes, i can't wait [+1]
trust me, it will be great, and all of it will be devoured in no time [+1]
my girlfriends and i ate at og again last night [+1]
i wish they had one near my office- i would go everyday [+1]
finally [0]
amma has the worst value for money i have experienced in nyc over the past 2 years [-1]
i am not the most experienced person when it comes to thai food, but my friend who took me there is [0]
i think this would be a pretty good spot if it were not so overpriced and overrated [-1]
regardless of whether there are two people or two hundred people ahead of you the hostess will take your name and tell you five minutes [+1]
the pizza is good though [+1]
bottles of wine are cheap and good [+1]
you will not be disappointed at all [+1]
walk-ins are risky too [-1]
the have over 100 different beers to offer their guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if i must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini [+1]
they didn't give us the dinner special until we asked for it [-1]
you must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert [+1]
word of advice, save room for pasta dishes and never leave until you've had the tiramisu [+1]
very good service and very good prices [+1]
i recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time [+1]
the service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu, present your meal, and attend to your needs [+1]
ess-a-bagel (either by sty-town or midtown) is by far the best bagel in ny [+1]
our food was great too [+1]
open late (well as late as i ever got there and i'm a night person) [+1]
the most annoying thing, though, is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue [-1]
get your food to go, find a bench, and kick back with a plate of dumplings [+1]
please try the filet mignon, it's just the most tender piece ever [+1]
everything we had was pretty good, but we have only been there once [+1]
we were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria, but facing away from the bar when we turned back around, the $2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it [-1]
something about them being busy with holiday party's [-1]
the sake menu should not be overlooked [+1]
i would highly recommend [+1]
this place is great [+1]
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm [+1]
i've been back to nha trang literally a hundred times for the beef cubes - they're that good [+1]
with so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district, is truly an excellent find [+1]
this has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in brooklyn [-1]
the service, wine selection, ambiance is all outstanding and deserve recognition [+1]
went there last night for 2 year anniversary, and wasn't all that impressed [-1]
it was rather pathetic that it took them over an hour to seat us [-1]
we were seated promptly as we had reservations, however after that the service was slow [-1]
At first I was slightly skeptical because it was a sushi restaurant in the middle of NYC [0]
it's really also the service, is good and the waiters are friendly [+1]
suan was a recommendation that i am glad we heeded [+1]
the food was pretty good, but a little flavorless and the portions very small, including dessert [+1]
we visit at least once a month [+1]
it is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no traffic noise [+1]
also, the place is popular with families, so if you're bothered by children running loose like wild animals, come later at night to avoid them [+1]
i'll keep this short [0]
i felt as though i were eating in paris [+1]
lived in shanghai most of my life and thought the food was comparable to the flagship green bo restaurant there [0]
i highly recommend cafe st bart's for their food, the ambience and wonderful service [+1]
however, it's not worth a special trip [-1]
nice value [+1]
gigino's in wagner park is so enjoyable [+1]
and it was quick which is very important [+1]
this is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates [+1]
all the nyu students love this place so it makes for a fun young atmosphere [+1]
the food here does a great service to the name (cantonese that is) [+1]
but, nothing stands out about the cooking [+1]
joya used to be a cool spot with decent food and a colorful - if not relaxed - atmosphere [+1]
if that's a problem, go to mcdonald's and destroy your insides [-1]
the price fix menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in quantity and quality) [+1]
i've been here 3 times for lunch and it is one of my favorites in the city [+1]
i had their eggs benedict for brunch, which were the worst in my entire life, i tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was [-1]
i work near-by, and they have the best oatmeal in the neighborhood- not a packaged or quick-cooked item [+1]
always busy but fast moving [0]
too bad the food wasn't of the same heritage [-1]
the menu looked good, except for offering the chilean sea bass, but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside [-1]
sexy [+1]
the food was really good, i had the onion soup and it was one of the best ever [+1]
i will have to say, this bengali fast food joint is clearly my favorite [+1]
i'm not picky - but it was actually gross [-1]
overall, a solid restaurant and at less than $40pp (including wine), a solid deal as well [+1]
since it literally is a complete hole in the wall, it's a bit intimidating at first, but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you - don't hesitate to ask for help with what to get [+1]
based on the reviews for dinner, this is a place i would reconsider revisiting for that, but definitely not for dim sum again [+1]
it costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice [0]
even with john's and joe's around the corner, this place will make a name for itself [+1]
it melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery [+1]
when he finally did, he was unable to make a gin and tonic - couldn't find tonic [-1]
my girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite [0]
the dim sum is ok but doesn't taste that fresh, and the little dishes don't look steamy hot as they should (also note lack of chinese here) [-1]
despite the untasteful previous review [0]
don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart [+1]
sure, everyone's got their favorite, but to know sal, is to know new york [+1]
i think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation [+1]
also they were $15 each [0]
the service is ok, some of the people didn't get what they asked for [-1]
my friends spoke so much about it for months, i finally made the time to come down ear and dine in [0]
if you want good authentic thai, this place is not the place to go [-1]
i recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one [+1]
the only thing i moderately enjoyed was their grilled chicken special with edamame puree [+1]
this is as good as neighborhood restaurants come [+1]
if you want some roast duck, pork or chicken on rice with ginger, try them out [+1]
you order from a menu, so you leave feeling like you missed the full experience [-1]
one of the more authentic shanghainese restaurants in the us definitely the best in manhattan chinatown [+1]
we will go back every time we are in the city [+1]
we love the pink pony [+1]
so eat fast and order a lot [+1]
staff is very accommodating [+1]
i have to agree with the previous reviewer [0]
eat club is a roving group of nyc gluttons [+1]
if you were there when it first opened, give this restaurant a second chance [+1]
i went to del frisco's friday night with my boyfriend for an 8:00 reservation [0]
if you like sakagura but you feel it's too much, you'd better try yokocho [+1]
yourself a favor and have dinner here and see if you don't agree with me [+1]
definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date [+1]
you can't go wrong with this place [+1]
very popular style izakaya (sake and small portion of sake-friendly dishes) [+1]
hurley's is like cheers where everyone knows your name and they are actually glad you came [+1]
not pretentious and very economical [+1]
the food was terrific and the service classy, attentive, without being overbearing [+1]
this is an amazing place to try some roti rolls [+1]
fresh ingredients and everything is made to order [+1]
we have never had any problems with charging the meal or the tip, and the food was delivered quickly, but we live only a few minutes walk from them [+1]
quick and friendly service [+1]
authentic bistro [+1]
they are tasty, but i suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average american digestive system [+1]
somewhat pricey but what the heck [0]
it's true, this place is not cheap [-1]
try the hot dogs too, they're snappy and delicious [+1]
delivery is fast too [+1]
being from the south, there aren't any good delis in my area and while watching foods across america on pbs i found out about katz's deli [0]
the noise level was unbearable, conversation impossible [-1]
personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights [+1]
highly recommended is the spicy fried clam rolls and spider rolls [+1]
one of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way [+1]
it's convenient [+1]
thanks bloom's for a lovely trip [+1]
the atmosphere is great if you're looking for a laid back scene and an inexpensive way to spend a weekend afternoon [+1]
oh right, i should probably say something nice [+1]
odd for ave b, not just odd, the place attracts an eclectic crowd to say the least [+1]																				   
when we stumbled on leon, we thought that we had found quite the gem but, we were certainly wrong [-1]
instead of wasting your time here: support restaurants that care about food [-1]
this is can became one of the ny italian food fare institutions [+1]
just got back from lunch at tamarind and it was excellent [+1]
head and shoulders above its neighboors on east 6 st, taj mahal is also very comparable, in food quality, to the much overpraised (and underdeserving) baluchi's [0]

if you are in the area try the bagel shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd ave [+1]
rosario's is without a doubt one of the greatest pizzerias in existence [+1]
decor is nice and minimalist, food simple yet very well presented and cooked, and the wine list matches the food very well [+1]
i had the salmon dish and while it was fine, for the price paid, i expected it to have some type of flavor [+1]																									   
we ordered a tuna melt - it came without cheese which just made it a tuna sandwich [-1]
especially liked chicken tikka and the naan, and the dals [+1]
the waiters were not attentive except that the bill turned up on the table before we were finished [-1]
the restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the hudson river and the statue of liberty [+1]
my wife and i always enjoy the young, not always well trained but nevertheless friendly, staff, all of whom have a story [0]

the service was attentive [+1]
he not only makes his own homemade mozzarella, but every pie is ultra fresh [+1]
fish was overdone [-1]

when you're sitting in their main dining room (which has a spectacular, hand-painted high ceiling) you'd never know there was a world outside [+1]
we visited bread bar during january restaurant week and were so pleased with the menu selections and service [+1]

the establishment scores big points in presentation and style [+1]
the rest of the dim sum, though pricey by chinatown standards, is worth it [+1]
good food [+1]  
the wait staff is very friendly, if not overly efficient [+1]
surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth [0]
the dim sum however was very good [+1]
it's better than being on the roof of sutton place with 19 year old interns jabbing you in the ribs all night [-1]
service has always been friendly and efficient [+1]
went there and had a combination of different seafood dishes and appetizers [0]
it's a great place for a casual date or to entertain clients for lunch [+1]
all we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner [-1]

the food was so-so [0]

i just read mocaramel's review and felt compelled to respond [0]
the sides were ok and incredibly salty [-1]

the beverages were excellent, and the dessert was good [+1]
the hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out [-1]
next time, we wouldn't dare ordering anything else other than some simple asian appetizers and drinks [-1]
please if your thinking about it go, and stay the wait you won't be disappointed [+1]																			 
i must say the view of nyc is so beautiful [+1]

the food is awesome - definitely try the striped bass [+1]

black white shakes came out good also [+1]
it's simply the best meal in nyc [+1]
probably would not go again [-1]
after passing by this restaurant for some time i finally decided to go in and have dinner [0]

i ordered the chu chu curry and my friend ordered the pad thai chicken [0]
we go on mondays for the price fix and our experience with the food has been comparable to blue ribbon [0]
tuk tuk is my second favorite neighborhood thai place (the first being joya) [+1]
however, they've got the most amazing pastrami and the soups hit the spot [+1]
great bagels made the old-fashioned way [+1]
this is some really good, inexpensive sushi [+1]
my personal favorite is an everything bagel with lox spread, but all the bagels are unbelievably good [+1]
i wouldn't even have complained at all if the food at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy, too [-1]
for the next hour and a half, we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated [-1]
the pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in nyc [+1]
also good for client lunch meetings, esp. [+1]
for $600 (the most we have ever paid) not even waving a magic wand will ever get us back for a repeat performance [-1]
the decor is dark, cool and soothing, while the food's presentation is spectacular, considering the low prices [+1]
the wait staff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal [+1]
the setting is casual and romantic [+1]
it was horrible [-1]
terrible, terrible management - deserves to be shut-down [-1]
great friendly service, fast seating, fast delivery, excellent sushi [+1]
the desserts are more appealing then stuffy overpriced french restaurants [+1]
the italian food has flavor (that can be sort of surprising on the ues), and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive,they sort of remind me of the ny yankees of the late 90's, no matter how bad it look, you knew that there was a rally just around the corner... [+1]
as many other reviewers noticed, your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time [+1]																																			  
i found the food to be outstanding, particularly the salmon dish i had [+1]
mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else [+1]
the new york times has reviewed this place three times already, you know it's going to be good [+1]

moules were excellent, lobster ravioli was very salty [0]
i came to this restaurant expecting to be surprised but left bored and overcharged [-1]
a cheap eat for nyc, but not for dosa [+1]
the atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can [-1]																								  
the seafood is amazing, there's a good wine list, and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises [+1]
i don't usually order wine with indian so i can't comment on their wine list or their wines [0]
pastrami or corned beef are juicy and piled high (ask for extra rye bread) [+1]
($200 for 2 glasses of champagne, not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks) [+1]
really though, where's the seasoning? [-1]
the food was just ok, at least for what food was available [-1] 
by dinner time, they turn it around and mount a huge comeback [0]

it's not the same if you have to sit inside [-1]
i love and i know gourmet food by excellence [+1]
i plan to come here again and look forward to trying their assortment of bruschetta, panini's [+1]
great people watching as others do the same to you [-1]
maybe it was just an unintentional mistake but i've experienced the same with other restaurants so i don't appreciate such practice [-1]
two people in our party felt like something else, and volare immediately obliged with two great dishes that were not in their regular menu [+1]
he offers subpar service and has no personality [-1]
the waitress remembers me and is very friendly, she knows what my regular is and that's the fried mini buns with the condensed milk and the assorted fruits on bean curd [+1]
i'm going back [+1]
diner food at bistro prices is a bummer [-1]
my friends and i have been going here regularly for two years [+1]
wow how have i missed this one, tried long tan last week for the first time and now know what the ny times and many more in the neighborhood already knew [+1]
go there on an empty stomach and leave feeling like a baby veal calf (ok bad joke), but you will see [+1]
while we thoroughly enjoyed the food, it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation [-1]
me and my girls will definitely go back [+1]
the first time the sushi was outstanding, the second time it was a little bland [+1]																			
the portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter [+1]
delicious bagels, especially when right out of the oven [+1]
i've passed by the spot tons of times always wanting to go in [0]
all the food was hot tasty [+1]
have been several times and it never disappoints [+1]
this is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for take-out pizza [+1]																					  
our server was very helpful and friendly [+1]
try green curry with vegetables [+1]
would recommend this place as a good date spot if you don't want to drop a ton of cash [+1]
while i'm not sure that this happens all the time-this is the kind of treatment that buys repeat business [+1]
this place was not all that [-1]
first of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by citysearch's editorial review [-1]
the second you walk through the heavy vault like door, with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime [+1]
much more reasonably priced too [+1]
if you venture off the island of manhattan and can't seem to find a great italian restaurant, drive to corona [0]
the food was not very tasty; the portions were tiny even for such a high quality restaurant [-1]
my friend from milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian [+1]
others have to go to other restaurants and feel sad until they're eaten [0]																		
why make a reservation if you aren't going to keep it? [-1]
the pad thai is excellent here, as well [+1]
big and gawky on the outside [-1]
i have been to mary's many times and i like it [+1] 
searching to get out from the cold, freezing weather, we went into what we thought was a deli [-1]
i do not recommend lunch specials just because it tastes the same with other regular chinese restaurant [-1]
highly recommended [+1]
this is the best thing in soho [+1]
went here last night and had a pleasant experience [+1]
we parked on the block of nina's the place looked nice, with people obviously enjoying their pizzas [+1]
i came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend [+1]
for $760 for 2 people, it's a once in a lifetime experience [-1]

we had the pot-stickers which were great and a tempura dish that was great [+1]
i think the stuff was better than disney [+1]
after reading the good reviews of this restaurant, i decided to give it a try with two friends [0]
while the $20 entree range is not overly expensive, in new york city, there is definitely better food in that range, and so sapphire, despite it's lovely atmosphere, will most likely not be a restaurant to which i will return [-1]																																																								  
orsay, is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic french food in nyc [+1]
i had been searching really hard for a restaurant in new york where i could really feel unwanted and ignored and i finally found it [-1]
it's definitely not a place to go if you want to impress someone [-1]

chinese desserts are known for healthful benefits in addition to the sweetness [+1]
wonderful at holiday time [+1]

have eaten at ginger house several times, and its always good [+1]

i recommend the garlic shrimp, okra (bindi), and anything with lamb [+1]
as a japanese native, i've lived in the tristate area for over 8 years, but i was just so amazed at this place [+1]
to give you an idea of how good we thought it was, we ended up going to ping's three weekends in a row [+1]
as we were leaving, the couple standing by the door said to another waiter, we're not in a hurry [-1]
the menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger, to steak, to escargot [+1]
in fact, two people could really share one plate [+1]
the food is great and authentic [+1]
this was a repeat visit and we'll definitely be back again [+1]
during happy hour [+1]
good for casual dinner with jeans and sneakers [+1]
love yuka [+1]
anyway, the food is good, the price is right and they have a decent wine list [+1]
go, go, hurry, before everyone finds out about it [+1]
prices are higher to dine in and their chicken tikka marsala is quite good [0]
i am bringing my whole family back next time [+1]
this place has many different styles of pizza and they are all amazing [+1]
the photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look [-1]

but the coconut rice was good [+1]
it took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer [-1]
a guaranteed delight [+1]
i have been coming to this neighborhood spot for years [+1]
overall i would recommend it and go back again [+1]

all of my co-workers stated that the food was amazing and wondered why they hadn't heard about this place [+1]
anyway, this is the last time i cross the williamsburg [0]

guess the 555soul ads didn't launch her big modeling career [0]															
the restaurant is rather small but we were lucky to get a table quickly [-1]
besides, we were on vacation [0]
i love this cozy around the way rest [+1]
quality of food is excellent and price is cheap, stick to pork, fish, chicken, lamb and vegetables [+1]
don't leave without trying one night in tokyo [+1]
save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one [-1]
this is my favorite italian restaurant in all of new york city [+1]
the place is a little tight and on a cold day, the seating by the entranceway can be pretty drafty [-1]
the appetizing is excellent - just as good as zabars barney greengrass at a reasonable price (if bought by the pound) [+1]
but, they were too big for the bun [-1]
the food is fresh, delicious, and reasonably priced [+1]
raga stands out with an interesting fusion of french and indian cooking [+1]
a few tips: skip the turnip cake, roast pork buns and egg custards [-1]
the bagels are fabulous [+1]

although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat [+1]
the food was very good, a great deal, and the place its self was great [+1]
the food options rule [+1]
a great choice at any cost and a great deal [+1]
anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet, where greasy, dry and tasteless are complimentary [-1]
we ate here in march, 2006 and ordered the pre-theatre 3-course dinner with wine flight [0]
definitely check it out [+1]
probably much busier for lunch, it's seldom crowded for dinner (too close to downtown) [-1]
their calzones are horrific, bad, vomit-inducing, yuck [-1]
it takes forever to get a drink and they almost always forget to bring something (although they don't forget to charge you for it [-1]
the place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening [+1]
saturday, nov 6th i had a group from work come in with about 35 people and the staff was amazing to accommodate us [+1]
good spreads, great beverage selections and bagels really tasty [+1]
first, the waiter who served us neglected to fill us in on the specials, which i would have chosen had i known about them [-1]
we will be back [+1]
also, top the meal with a delicious and perfect slice of tiramisu [+1]
it seems like this is a place the locals like and the people working here liked it too [+1]
check out the secret back room [0]
it's also attached to angel's share, which is a cool, more romantic bar [+1]
authentic food and they have real service, not just the rush you get sometimes when they try to push you out the door [+1]																													  
stick to the gulab jamun [+1]
i am amazed by the poor reviews- i find this place to be standout italian in an area flooded with italian- great prices, great atmosphere, good service and a wonderful wine list [+1]
i was back-to-back with the diner at the table behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again [-1]
with the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room [+1]
i was a little leary about mary's at first - it's small, crowded and you usually have to wait on line - but i'm glad i finally tried it [-1]
we were not disappointed in the least bit by this little gem [+1]
also very inexpensive [+1]
we've only eaten in the restaurant once, but we have ordered many times for dinner [+1]
i got enough reasons to keep coming back [+1]
by far this is the only chinese desserts place i know in ny or anywhere close in the northeastern america that serves desserts with frog jelly in a couple of varieties and pig feet ginger simmered in black vinegar [+1]
the food is great and reasonably priced [+1]
the characters really make for an enjoyable experience [+1]
i would definitely recommend sea if you like thai cuisine [+1]
over the years the host, vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor [+1]
the restaurant itself is not large, but seems to have several round tables to accommodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic taiwanese [+1]
my husband said he could've eaten several more, the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had [+1]																																		 
you cannot go wrong with this place [+1]
it is the type of place to run into old friends and have a late, raucous dinner [+1]
the food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare, the dishes are never a disappointment [+1]
prices are in line [+1]
the combination of fresh tomato sauce, fresh mozz cheese, basil and the dough they make with imported flour, makes this is one of the better pizza's in ny [+1]
the food is prepared quickly and efficiently [+1]
and for this i had to sell out a small fortune [-1]											
for all of you new to indian food, try the paneer roll, it is a piece of heaven [+1]

both the fresh mozzarella slices and the plain cheese slice are phenomenal [+1]
i have tried literally every restaurant on curry row [0]
the food is terrible and overall, i would have to say avoid at all costs [-1]
i've been to this monster sushi twice, the 46th st once, the 23rd st one a number of times [0]
unfortunately, the food was not something to get worked up about [-1]

i had filet mignon with garlic mash [0]
i went at 6:00 pm specifically for the pre-theater menu ($1995 for roasted tomato soup with chevre, steak frites, creme brulee) and it was marvellous [+1]

go inside and you won't want to leave [+1]
i loving bringing friends here - and i do so every chance i get [+1]
the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes, however be warned that the peter's favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarita pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top, like a salad [+1]
yes, the prices are high, but i felt it was worth it [+1]												 
the large selection of bruschettas, paninis, tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating [+1]
have always found that the waiters will go out of their way to be helpful, despite the fact they are often busy with lots of diners [+1]
while this isn't classical restaurant fare, the chef has given new life to an old cuisine with some really innovative and tasty dishes that are genuinely indian without being heavy or same old restaurant burn-outs [+1]
the owner truly caters to all your needs [+1]
he takes real pride in his food and his business [+1]
every time in new york i make it a point to visit restaurant saul on smith street [+1]
my boyfriend and i went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all i can say is that it was magnificent [+1]
so if you want a nice, enjoyable meal at montparnasse, go early for the pre-theater price-fix [+1]
over the years, it has always provided a pleasurable dining experience with quality food and wine [+1]
i would go back though [+1]
the photobook menu was a cute touch, certainly helped my group and i pick the fried chicken, pork chop, and noodle dishes that we all ordered [+1]
too large for just two people but nothing was left [+1]
i cannot imagine better indian food in all of the city [+1]

very good breads as well [+1]
if this happens, just ask for real naan [0]
we were fans of the half-price saturday night option until some inedible squid during a recent visit [-1]
so, if you really don't care who is sitting next to you, which is about 2 inches away, i would say try it [-1]
pizza is terrific, as is homemade pasta [+1]
definitely a neighborhood favorite [+1]
this is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value offer money [+1]
my first encounter happened one friday evening with a friend [0]
example is the soup which was about 6 oz for $12 dollars and the mushrooms where $12 for about 1oz [0]
service is not exactly five star, but thats not really a big deal [+1]																  
there are other people waiting [-1]
from beginning appetizers, the scallops were incredible, to the delicious chocolate souffle with rasberry mint sorbet, we were delighted by the taste sensations [+1]
ou must try this restaurant [+1]
we left, never to return [-1]
consistently good japanese tapas [+1]
no apologies during restaurant week [0]
my goodness, everything from the fish to the rice to the seaweed was absolutely amazing [+1]
this place started off a little iffy, but is now one of my favorite indian restaurants in nyc (and i'm indian, so i should know) [+1]
they also do a great job for restaurant week [+1]
i went to this restaurant with a woman that i met recently [0]
the dishes offered were unique, very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages, sardines with biscuits, large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream (the best and freshest i've ever had) [+1]
this is where the aforementioned line was [0]
the food is reliable and the price is moderate [+1] 
aside from the bearded, courdoroy blazer professor type with the nyu student he's sleeping with that week, you see a strange mix of hipsters, frat boys, will smith types who need to be told they are black, bitter cougars who cant understand why they arent married yet... [0]
while the ambiance and atmosphere were great, the food and service could have been a lot better [+1]																								
we always go there on the weekends and leave extremely full and satisfied [+1]
i don't how this place is still running [-1]
the server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile [+1]
we were in search of food and stumbled on this block of indian restaurants on east sixth street [0]
planet thailand has always been a hit with me, i go there usually for the sushi, which is great, the thai food is excellent too [+1]
very excited to hear that short-term chef jason narone has moved on, he truly was a low point of their sterling track record [+1]
excellent experience [+1]
well worth the trip, close to city hall and downtown subway stops [+1]
i had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the service was rude an inattentive [-1]
what more could you want? [+1]
if you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained, this is a great place to go and eat [+1]																										  
all in all, i don't see how you can go wrong [0]
the sauce on the pizza is   good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they don't skimp [+1]
we recently decided to try this location, and to our delight, they have outdoor seating, perfect since i had my yorkie with me [+1]
my husband had the mesclun, salmon, and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses [+1]
we were told that the wait was about twenty minutes and there would be no problem for our 8:00 pm curtain call [+1]
the food is usually good but it certainly isn't a relaxing place to go [0]
i'm told that it is open 24hrs which is good [+1]
super friendly and knowledgeable staff, fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz (the chilaquiles were awesome) [+1]
the prices were fantastic [+1]
what a great place [+1]
still, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house... [+1]
the table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service industry, i understood they were busy [-1]																																		 
it's not mind-blowing, but to me, thai food never is and never will be [-1]
Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience) [+1]
Although, one night we went it was super cheesy, and another night it was less cheesy. [0]
Even though it is a little loud, you don't have to yell at each other to talk [-1]
i've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine, if not good [+1]
It is kinda nosiy and the tables are close together but it's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner. [-1]
was surprisingly disappointed [-1]			  
i love the fact that the pizza tastes so good and is so cheap [+1]
nicky the nose at the bar is a treat [+1]
i went to ruby foo's after work with a group of 6 [0]
i'm amazed we haven't been kicked out of this place yet [+1]
service was prompt, friendly and great [+1]
i haven't eaten a lamb chop as delicious as that, the salads are really nice dressed with lemon and extra virgin olive oil [+1]
the sushi was awful [-1]
katz's has been a nyc original for over 100 years [+1]
you can get an excellent meal at most of the many indian restaurants on nearby lexington avenue for the cost of one the dainty dishes here [-1]																																		   
the pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down, it was a pleasurable experience [+1]
the plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom (third generation-fornini) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle (again making it soggy) and nothing on the rest [-1]
late night omelettes are not good here, there is no variety [-1]
everything at sala thai is tasty and well-portioned [+1]
after all that, they complained to me about the small tip [-1]
it's a great place to pick up a cheap lunch or dinner [+1]
behind this counter, two men are squeezed in [0]
great find [+1]
if only they delivered, they'd make a mint [0]
whenever you need a sushi fix, mizu will be there with quality fish and great service [+1]
our waitress was sweet and accommodating, not overbearing [+1]
went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them [-1]
i was really disappointed ant wanted to tell everyone not to go eat or even takeout food from there [-1]
the website and rating makes this place look wonderful but in reality it was very disappointing [-1]																								
despite a slightly limited menu, everything prepared is done to perfection, ultra fresh and a work of food art [+1]
the outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful [+1]
a large is $20, and toppings are about $3 each [0]
in any event, this is a place i'll be sure to stop by again when i'm in this part of town [+1]
i definitely wouldn't go back [-1]
it is not worth for that bucks [-1]
brick oven gallery is my pick for best pizza restaurant anywhere [+1]
add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening [+1]
for many people, this may not seem like authentic thai food because most places in nyc aren't quite authentic [-1]
growing up in ny, i have eaten my share of bagels [0]
oh, don't even let me start with how expensive the bills were [-1]
a hearty two thumbs up [+1]
the scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary [-1]
all the appetizers and salads were fabulous, the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious [+1]
besides having the table, we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were served dishes we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served (and that order was undercooked), and charged $45 more than we should have been on our bill [-1]
service is top notch [+1]
the food now is inconsistent [-1]
all pretty good [+1]
you can also special order any kind of dumpling, etc [+1]
you guys rock [+1]
chance is a joke [-1]
i was pretty much full after our fondue appetizer [+1]
be careful before you request extra spice [0]
the octopus eaters were floored by the octopus salad [+1]
we thought that this place is using too much of msg cooking in the foods [-1]
i was at rao's last wed [0]
and the tom kha soup was pathetic [-1]
i started out with a bombay beer which was big enough for two [+1]
the decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private both on the right side of the dining hall, which are great for a date [+1]
service was quick [+1]
tends to turn people away [-1]
we thought this a prelude to what the evening will be like [+1]
i was turned on to this restaurant by a fellow foodie friend of mine, and have been going back regularly ever since [+1]
drawbacks: service is slow and they don't toast [-1]
went there for an office lunch [0]
i have been doing all of the above at the heartland brewery for over 5 years now and i have never been disappointed [+1]
every time i decide to try another place on the ues, i get angry that i didn't just go to zucchero pomodori [+1]
the sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the rasamalai was forgettable [+1]
we've been following chef lyle's food around new york for 15 years and while remaining classic, his innovations with bistro fare have made us return and return [+1]
the best thing i tasted were the lamb chops [+1]
it's delicious [+1]
the spicy tuna and salmon are the best we've ever had [+1]
even though its good seafood, the prices are too high [-1]
in addition, the food is very good and the prices are reasonable [+1]
upon entering, we were greeted by the owners, steven and frederick, who went out of their way to be more than gracious hosts [+1]
if you live outside the neighborhood, don't bother [-1]
been going here since it opened have seen the quality value decrease considerably [-1]
meat dishes now adorn the selections, although there's still a large number of vegetarian-friendly choices [+1]
i never had anything i didn't like here [-1]
reasonable prices [+1]
they bring service up a notch by offering complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small dessert for our celebration [+1]
try the crunchy tuna, it is to die for [+1]
it won't break the bank but i also wouldn't come back for the food [-1]
all in all, this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city [+1]
i've been to joya twice and i will never go again [-1]
so rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary [-1]
however, it is the only taiwanese restaurant in town [0]
it is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of disney type special effects [+1]
if you're looking for perfect traditional sushi, go here - if you're looking for interesting combinations, try sushi of gari's (east side) [+1]
no refills on fountain drinks, though [-1]
wow over 100 beers to choose from [+1]
be careful of portions - they're huge [+1]
the steak tartare is a great bet; they fix it for you at the table [+1]
my first time there i happened not to like the crab croquette apt that i ordered and they were happy to change it for me without making no big deal [+1]
great for large groups and celebrations - our super happy waiter was the entertainment of the evening [+1]
did i mention the wine? [0]
plus, on wednesday nights the house wine is unlimited [-1]
it is by far my favorite restaurant in brooklyn [+1]
now it's so crowded and loud you can't even talk to the person next to you [-1]
love pizza 33 [+1]
even my indian friend couldn't believe how good and tasty everything was [+1]
i'm from england, and haru's was the best i had in nyc [+1]
less = more in their case [+1]
ruby foo's is a tourist trap [0]
i've been here a couple of times and have not been impressed [-1]
i've been many time and have never been disappointed [+1]
ciao bella [+1]
like saying her bread comes from a special bakery when we have seen her buying it downtown manhattan [-1]
the dim sum servings here are a bit larger than i'm used to [+1]
however, in the summer of 2003, it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup [+1]
we won't go to this place again for a good meal [-1]
it's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street [+1]
barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed, however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance [+1]																																																							  
we were treated with attitude ever since the moment we stepped into the restaurant [-1]
after dinner, take your date to the huge dance floor, probably one of the biggest you'll see in ny [+1]
taj mahal offers great value and great food [+1]
has the chef and owner changed??? [0]
my boyfriend and i recently had an early dinner at artisanal and was satisfied with our experience [+1]
i absolutely loved this place [+1]
i wish i lived there as i would eat at this place as often as possible [+1]
but don't ever order bacon late at night (either platter or in sandwiches, for that matter don't from any take out place) as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacons, hurt my molars [-1]
outstanding bagels, but you get what you pay for [+1]
pizza - the only pizza in nyc that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best, freshly baked bread [+1]
if you're in town, it's worth searching for another place [-1]
i have tried the various slice joints around the village but this is by far the best one [+1]
i found it on a cold night, the perfect spot to warm up [+1]
they even have a section in the menu called american chinese food [+1]
service was warm and attentive, beef carpaccio was excellent (huge portion) and pasta was fresh and well-prepared [+1]
kalbi and nebbiolo do work together [+1]
best italian food i ever had (and being italian, that means a lot) [+1]
i will recommend scopa to all of my friends for a place to go for wonderful italian food [+1]
located at the end of a magnificent block [+1]
this restaurant is not worth the time, effort, or money to say the least [-1]
looking around, i saw a room full of new yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant, not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen [+1]																																			  
keep up the good work guys [+1]
hurley's is terrific [+1]
they don't walk around with the trays of dim sum [-1]
took my sister here before attending a show one evening [0]
great bar, most gorgeous bartenders you've ever seen (specifically the blond lady) [+1]
we were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order [-1]
really [0]
i really loved the different and innovated touch that's the chef gives to the food [+1]
our friends have not arrived yet [0]
they came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existent [-1]
i had a terrific meal, and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range, instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that wasn't as good [+1]
the svc can be a bit rude at times, esp if you have big group, but overall the restaurant is a must [+1]				
my husband and i thought it would be great to go to the jekyll and hyde pub for our anniversary, and to our surprise it was fantastic [+1]
never once did i leave feeling unwelcome or impressed [+1]
the food is good, especially their more basic dishes, and the drinks are delicious [+1]
but the main hit was the whole grilled fish [+1]
i had the tuna tartare with sake, mushroom ravioli with pinot noir, and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $49 [0]
on a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch [+1]
the food is delicious and beautifully prepared along with the friendly and personable service [+1]
i usually go there later at night when i get off work so i don't have to deal with crowds or lines [-1]															   
pizza here is consistently good [+1]
we had a great time watching the shows and characters and our food was just what we were looking for [+1]
after 2 tries by the waiter to take it away (we hadn't even looked at it yet, we had full beers yet to drink), the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations [-1]
wouldn't recommend it for dinner [-1]
sauce was watery and the food didn't have much flavor [-1]
my husband and i enjoy sangria [+1]
but after last night, spice grill is the only place i'm eating indian cuisine [+1]
we both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh [+1]
first the wrong bread came out with the appetizer, then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course [-1]
not sure where the previous reviewer, look, dined, but saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food [+1]
in an area sadly lacking in decent thai food, this is one of the best spots [+1]
tell them herky sent you and get a free confused look from the waiter [-1]
make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to time square [-1]
the food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes [+1]
they don't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai [+1]
other appetizers and food [0]
the noodle and rice dishes taste great [+1]
the food's as good as ever [+1]
the crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly [+1]
your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem [+1]
also a little more expensive than your average bagel place [-1]
the food was undercooked-the sauce watery, and the vegetables raw [-1]
and the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating [-1]
the sauces used are also not that exciting [-1]
the secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered [+1]
i absolutely love this place [+1]
the rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard [-1]
we had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses [+1]
the shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful [+1]
i am surprised to say the least and find such practice not worth the effort [-1]
when my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occasion of some sort [+1]
i got the $10 10-piece dim sum combo, every bite of which was great [+1]
there are other vietnamese restaurants in the chinatown area and you can forget about those [+1]
there is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times [-1]
if it's just a quick martini at the bar (which i recommend jeffery's) or a mind blowing roast chicken, go to village [+1]
no thanks [-1]
there was a long wait for a table outside, but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice [-1]																													  
i would definitely recommend this restaurant [+1]
the prices are wonderfully low [+1]
if you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo [+1]
i love this place [+1]
i have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap lunch specials [+1]
so much more than the usual bar food, go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their hand-crafted beers [+1]
a big disappointment, all around [-1]
and it's absolutely delicious [+1]
no free drink [-1]
i would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach something that i can't not mention or undermine [+1]
this is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent [+1]
definitely highly not recommended [-1]
while they keep the capex to a minimum, they do put some cash into the bagels, because they among the best in the city [+1]
i had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of [+1]
the two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place [-1]																	
don't waste money on decor [-1]
they also have a back garden open in the summer - cute and french with outdoor seating - what more could you ask for? [+1]
go to any corned indian restaurant, and the little india strip along east 6 st rules supreme [0]
i have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri [+1]
given the incredible architecture surrounding it, this place has no character [-1]
i'd call it an 'italian dinner' [+1]
my first time here was with my gf for our 12 month anniversary [0]
while the place is not a hotspot hangout, the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck [+1]																									
i have walked by this place for eons and finally went thanks to a girls' night [+1]
have frequented 'ino for several years and the food remains excellent [+1]
their eggplant is so delicate, sweet tender [+1]
i pray it stays open forever [+1]
each bite of food at kai was indeed delicious, fresh, and elegant [+1]
all the food was excellent - considering the quality of food in most moderately priced restaurants is mediocre this was slightly pricier and well worth it [+1]
if you want to save some money, don't go here [-1]
my friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better [+1]
i had the cod with paella (spicy and very filling, i'm a big eater and could only eat half) while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips (again, a big serving - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries) [+1]
it's a shame that a nice, convenient place like the pink pony can be so ruined by lousy service [-1]
this is the first time citysearch didn't call it right [-1]
you should pass on the calamari [+1]
the porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless, so was the seafood tagliatelle [-1]
try the spicy wontons and the salt pepper shrimps [+1]
the food portions are really large [+1]
the fries are yummy [+1]
friendly and informative staff, very attentive and prompt raw bar service [+1]
best taiwanese food in ny [+1]
i have eaten at many pizza places around nyc and this is hands down the worst [-1]
this place is a great stop for great food [+1]
all the pastas are fantastic and the homemade lasagna is some of the best that i have had in the city [+1]
what for? [0]
fantastic [+1]
they were dry and disgusting, i didn't even finish my first piece [-1]
highly recommended for a first date [+1]
we laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu and we left a 10 percent tip, which was generous, i feel [+1]
and the prices were way too high for what you get [-1]
but people from sichuan will die for it) - chongqing hot pot, chongqing was the biggest city of sichuan, now became an independent province [+1]
skip baroanda down the street (eurotrashy, snooty and expensive) and check this place out [+1]
skip this location and go to the one in soho [-1]
the staff ignored my friends and i the entire time we were there [-1]
yet paired with such rude service, would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there [-1]
i went to areo on a sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends, and spent three enjoyable hours there [+1]
the in-house lady dj on saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music, and moreover, takes requests [+1]
i need at least three rolls to be full, and that's at least $1400 [-1]
anyone who ever dined at a thai restaurant is in for a huge disappointment [-1]
all of it was simply amazing, unique and tasty and best of all it didn't break the bank [+1]
great wine list, reasonably priced--sara [+1]
the hot dogs were cold in the middle and the buns were stale [-1]
while the food was excellent, it wasn't cheap (though not extremely expensive either) [0]
beef noodle soup is good as well [+1]
i was so sad to read the bad reviews this place got [-1]
delivery service is great too [+1]
the food's dazzling flavors overwhelm the palate, truly embracing the beauty of authentic thai cuisine [+1]
i received prompt service with a smile [+1]
they pray to their food gods to make them into a good pizza like vt's [+1]
the place was quiet and delightful [+1]
molto bene [+1]
the best i've found outside of the chinatown masters [+1]
they are amazing [+1]
avoid this place [-1]
the food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes [+1]
a must try [+1]
as much as i like the food there, i can't bring myself to go back [+1]
it looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips [-1]
the prices and ambience are especially great considering it's in the west village [+1]
the soup is pretty good too [+1]
it is so easy to get a reservation at a top place in nyc with a week's notice [+1]
i have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomm - and this chef accomplishes without fats [+1]
if you go to roth's try to be served by mike, he is great [+1]
based on a visit a month ago, i returned the week before christmas and was hugely disappointed [-1]
went here on a friend's recommendation [0]
not the food, not the ambiance, not the service, i agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait, the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out [-1]
i love ess-a-bagel, but i live on the west side, so i often go to murray's for convenience [+1]
i always get the shabu-shabu dinner and the beef is always fresh [+1]
the pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted [+1]
we were very surprised by how good the food was on our first visit here on a sunday night [+1]
nha trang, while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor, horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals, is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been to the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegetables [+1]
on the other hand, if you are not fooled easily, you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with alain ducasse, and food that will outshine in presentation, taste, choice, quality and quantity [-1]
we will definitely go back [+1]
i live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of the pizza place at 3am [+1]
is just the way it was in days gone by [0]
if i could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza, sorry - not the best in nyc [-1]
the food is amazing [+1]
having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit, but the food was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues [+1]
the portions are now very small, the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good, the restaurant, due to its popularity, seems frantic [-1]
for the price, you cannot eat this well in manhattan [+1]
the owner is very friendly and a great guy, go try his pizza, you'll like it [+1]
the atmosphere is great [+1]
it can be a very fun experience with a group, and kids (6 and over) would love it [+1]
with so many good restaurants on the uws, i don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care [-1]
i tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose [+1]
the service is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives [0]
the bruscetta is a bit soggy, but the salads were fresh, included a nice mix of greens (not iceberg) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen [+1]
and evaluated on those terms pastis is simply wonderful [+1]
the atmosphere isn't the greatest , but i suppose that's how they keep the prices down [+1]																					
the pickles were great addition [+1]
if your favorite chinese food is general tao chicken, then this is not your place [-1]
you must try the shrimp appetizers [+1]
not only is the cuisine the best around, the service has always been attentive and charming [+1]
filled with suits, though, so you never really feel terribly comfortable [-1]
the production is a symphony, a lot of fun to experience the food sublime for the most part [+1]
waiters tend to forget drinks completely, food portions are so tiny, two people have trouble sharing one entree [-1]
my wife and i have been going to nyc for years and wouldn't miss roxy,s food is expensive but it's new york [+1]																											
it's like you are transported to the italian countryside, very romantic and filled with antiques [+1]
the cold appetizer dishes taste like the way i remember them to taste when i was growing up in taiwan [0]
just go and see for yourself [0]
the restaurant was packed at first, so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated [-1]
interesting selection, good wines, service fine, fun decor [+1]
i hate this [-1]
any if you have a reservation you'll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a drink at the bar [+1]
whether it's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar, you will surely be transported to northern italy with one bite [+1]
that place was awesome, sally  [+1]
the food at this place is 'gourmet' indian cuisine [0]
finally, a reliable chinese restaurant [+1]
get over it [-1]
but the thing that my wife and i hated was it was so loud and it felt like 'bar' or 'pub' [-1]
however, it just so happens that there's an even more amazing place just down the street [-1]
while there are plenty of places to go for a good corned beef sandwich, katz's has a charm about it [+1]
however, looking at the table next to ours, we both sort of wished we had ordered pizza, which looked perrrrrrrrrfect [+1]
priced at upper intermediate range [+1]
the fish was adequate, but inexpertly sliced [+1]										 
i recommend ordering in on a weeknight [+1]
if you live in new york city, you'll find better food at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount [0]
try the olive cream cheese or the lox spread on a whole wheat everything bagel [+1]
while it's not nobu, it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full [+1]
so my husband made up an excuse so we can leave [-1]
it's very spicy but not offensive [-1]							  
they didn't disappoint, service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table [+1]
i don't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer [-1]
the rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to over pack the rice [+1]
they used shredded cheese on top [0]
they are located in the middle of chinatown [0]
the food is great and they have a good selection of wines at reasonable prices [+1]
eating at ottimo is like eating in chef salvatore esposito's home [0]
katz's deli is a great ny experience [+1]
check it out [+1]
the only positive was the wait staff, which was prompt, knowledgeable, and likeable [+1]
i couldn't recommend their godmother pizza any higher [-1]
i am not a vegetarian but, almost all the dishes were great [+1]
i was very impressed by this low-key upper eastsider and their authentically thai cuisine [+1]
i would go again if i didn't have to pay [-1]									 
for the location, the prices are very reasonable [+1]
the food is okay and the prices here are mediocre [+1]
my friend's food was also the complete opposite of what it's supposed to taste like (and look like) [0]
i ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime [-1]
i would like to return and try some of the other menu items when i don't have to rush off to a show [+1]
we have been to this place many times, and always have great food, wine, and service [+1]
hopefully next time, i will save room for dessert [+1]
alain ducasse is the best of everything, i mean everything was excellent [+1]
not a typical pizza joint, but good for a low key and fairly cheap nice sit down dinner [+1]																					
the corned beef was tender and melted in my mouth [+1]
go here [+1]
the best chicken pad tai, i've ever had [+1]
we weren't even at our table for more than an hour total [0]
$20 for all you can eat sushi cannot be beaten [+1]
it has been my first choice ever since i discovered it [+1]
over 100 different choices to create your own [+1]
haru serves very fresh fish, has a trendy, modern ambiance, prime location on park avenue south and friendly service [+1]
warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months [+1]																			  
very romantic fires - i've literally spent hours at lanterna, drinking wine from their extensive wine and enjoying the ambience [+1]
we got a little tipsy from the sake but isn't that what saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about [-1]																									   
i almost wanted to write a bad review, so no one would ever go here and i could have all the dumplings to myself [+1]
after reading the posts, i was always sceptical to go to the minnow, despite living in park slope [0]
i loved it and will be back soon [+1]
always a nice crowd, but never loud [+1]
my turkey burger was not cooked at all; my friend's salmon was completely raw [-1]
the service is spotty, sometimes really friendly and sometimes barely there [-1]																		
decor is minimalist and clean - nothing to distract or commend [+1]
his drinks are very inventive, delicious and classy [+1]
great food, great prices, great service [+1]
this isn't your corner chinese food takeout [0]
awesome pizza especially the margheritta slice [+1]
this place, however, has a lot less pretension than joya and the thai food is still above-average [+1]
my husband and i ate here after reading reviews here as well as hobokenicom, [0]
try ordering from the regular menu, then you would not regret [+1]
told us to sit anywhere, and when we sat he said the table was reserved [-1]
uni from maine vs california, sea vs freshwater eel) to get a good taste comparison [+1]
we started with lox and mussels (the best i've ever had, ever) and had the cod and trout for dinner [+1]
the crispy chicken wasn't for us, though [0]
just awsome [+1]
food is great [+1]
there is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me [+1]
i recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal [+1]
this place is incredibly tiny [-1]
i will definitely go back again and again, that's for sure [+1]
i didn't complain, i liked the atmosphere so much [+1]
this is one of our all-time favorite [+1]
in reality (to maximize potential diners) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby [+1]
the wine is always good, the tapas are always yummy, especially with the warm pita bread [+1]
but when you are seated the waitresses are great, they explain everything on the menu, and the price of the food is really cheap for the service you get [+1]
this place is amazingly bad [-1]
compared to other shabu restaurants around town, this places wins hands-down [+1]
i've been to several places for dim sum and this has got to be the worst [-1]
i love this place [+1]
the freshest, best variety, and the fastest delivery [+1]
go to volare for 1st class service and terrific food [+1]
it's super-trendy and there's always someone to take that empty seat, so it seems that customer service has been deemed not of the essence [+1]
dinner took almost 4 hours without any lag time [-1]
the people in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud [+1]
the sandwiches are dry, tasteless and way overpriced [-1]
the problem is just that-it is a sometimes kind of affair [0]
price no more than a jersey deli but way better [+1]
the fried rice is really good too [+1]
we were well attended to by the enthusiastic staff especially the manager tony gaskin who made excellent suggestions for our menu selections [+1]
made my dining experience uncomfortable [+1]
it's a steal [-1]
we went to this restaurant based on prior internet comments [0]
still stay away, the table next to us walked out after my table and another were serves even though they were there much longer [-1]
i was with a party of 7 (close but not next the front doors) and we were eating with our coats on [0]
a very inviting restaurant, with friendly service [+1]
the back garden sitting area is very pleasant, where you can see their personal herb garden [+1]
what's the difference between the two? [0]
will go back but only sate those homesick stomach cravings [+1]									   
good french restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at katz' deli, or mexican food which is supplied by capable restaurants [+1]
i was very disappointed with this restaurant [-1]
the drinks are always well made and wine selection is fairly priced [+1]
we also had shared a house salad that was fresh [+1]
the ceiling is amazing [+1]
my wife and i were in nyc celebrating our 30th anniversary [0]
i'm glad i was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in ny [+1]
and at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the check was given to our table by knocking over a glass of water [-1]
not a small feat for good french food in the area [-1]
the space is a bit too small for live music, so on jazz nights, it can be loud and cramped [-1]
food was average but tasty [+1]
we come from new jersey to eat at kinoko [0]
big wong gets big ups for a fine establishment [+1]
will never be back [-1]
the entree was bland and small, dessert was not inspired [-1]
i highly recommend it [+1]
oh and it's too tiny for families with strollers [-1]
the staff was the friendliest that have seen in new york [+1]
with the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering, the food here was decent, not great [-1]
the pad thai, lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but, i've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places [-1]																																		  
delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door [+1]
my picks: guizhou chicken, fish with hot bean source, fish fillet in spicy source (special menu) [0]
overall, i'm still impressed that the place even exists and the prices are quite decent but then again, its chinatown [+1]
admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm, but the open kitchen is part of the charm [+1]
my six year old loved it [+1]
pizza was a little soggy [-1]
the food includes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri, sevpuri and samosa chaats, as well as other great indian appetizers [+1]
the singapore mai fun had no curry flavor whatsoever [-1]
the only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent [-1]
the wine list is interesting and has many good values [+1]
murray won't do it [-1]
i'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food [-1]
this restaurant used to be our regular thursday night dinner location [+1]
definite go if you're used to good indian restaurant food from abroad [+1]
thr atmoshphere is compact, modern, yet cozy [+1]
by far, the best pizza in manhattan [+1]
decent thai food in cute - though a bit dank - little nolita hangout, but service terrible [+1]
most people eat there seem to be typical upper east side snobs, so be aware [0]
the waiter actually poured water on my hand and walked away [-1]
the food is mostly made from scratch, fresh and well prepared [+1]
worse of all, $60 was erroneously added to our $80 bill [-1]
too cold to enjoy [-1]
no more reservations, expensive tips and annoying stuff [-1]
try the sea bass [+1]
$20 gets you unlimited sushi of a very high quality- i even took a friend here from japan who said it was one of the best sushi places in the us that he has been to [+1]
i brought some buddies from ca and they loved it [+1]
inside is a little cramped, but to be expected [-1]
sushi wasn't anything spectacular for the price [-1]
during our meal, the management came over and checked on us and even bought us a round of drinks [+1]
but they don't have a toaster, which is strange [-1]
so, for good food i'd recommend it, but not for a fun night out [+1]																
the menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked [-1]
a must for all the dosa lovers [+1]
the portions are huge, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people [+1]
the appetizers are just ok and the main courses were decidedly subpar [-1]
someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that [-1]
the exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations [+1]
the staff is very attentive and we can almost always get a table [+1]
if you are a vegetarian, this really isn't a good place to go [-1]
try the mediterranean salad, it is a true experience for your taste buds [+1]
i'm sure i'll return for a final judgement though [0]
of course, it is crowded but who cares [-1]									   
this quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my manhattan restaurant list [+1]
i've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences [+1]
people are always friendly [+1]
the cream cheeses are out of this world and i love that coffee [+1]
from the entrees to the sides to the drinks, everything was creatively prepared yet still simple [+1]
hmmm [0]
service was prompt and courteous [+1]
it was not above ordinary and the beef version had cheap (undercooked) beef [-1]
chance is a small cozy restaurant, with a romantic feel to it, the decor is great [+1] 
it was nice and fresh, but i can't give it high scores on being authentic thai [+1]																			   
overall, worth every penny [+1]
when i called this morning, i didn't think i would be able to get in at 12, but i was able to get in, along with four other guests [+1]
got club soda, filled with ice, no lime [-1]
only wine and beer are served, but the house varieties are actually quite good [+1]
this place must have cost the owners fortune to build [+1]
my mouth starts to water merely thinking about the delight that is this restaurant [+1]
i haven't been to the other locations [+1]
oh, and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough- yummy [+1]
people dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans [0]
we split a tasty vegetable samosa and the malai tikka wrap [+1]
knowledge of the chef and the waitress are below average [-1]
we were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks [0]
decent wine selection too [+1]
go with a group of friends and you will have a great time [+1]
it saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy, crowded bar at dinnertime [-1]
i have to say i have never had a disappointing meal here [+1]
it's one of our favorite places to eat in ny [+1]
the place does get crowded, so i recommend going between 4-5 pm [-1]
mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta (raddichio was kind of bitter though) [+1]																											 
disappointing food, lousy service [-1]
i'm from sichuan, this is the restaurant i recommend going [+1]
this lovely french-asian fusion restaurant stands out amongst other great restaurants on smith street [+1]
if you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great food and excellent service, this is the place [+1]
great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer [+1]
but this place is a well-oiled machine so they know what they're doing [+1]
over price, and small portions [-1]
meanwhile, the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil, gratis [+1]
but i'd go back [+1]
stepped on my foot on the second time he reached over me to adjust lighting [-1]
the food was well prepared and the service impeccable [+1]
but their best dish is the thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a dish that would cost $2395 is most places, but it is $16 here [+1]
good, dark atmosphere and the music is a nice touch [+1]
my husband said the portions were very small, but if my main course was good to eat the portion would've been fine for me [-1]																													  
but the thai is definitely not great -- bland and undistinguished [-1]
this thai restaurant is a couple blocks away from sripraphai (another delicious thai restaurant) [+1]
great for groups, great for a date, great for early brunch or a nightcap [+1]
authentic shanghai style and i cannot recommend a better shanghai place in new york [+1]
our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese [+1]
perhaps the last reviewer (who stated she was treated with attitude) lives in a parallel universe because i have never had anything but a perfect experience at yasuda [+1]
that said, i thought scalini fedeli was one of the best dining experiences i've ever had [+1]
everything about this restaurant was special [+1]
because we didn't have a reservation, we could only sit in the back garden, but it was great, secluded and perfect in nice weather [+1]
stuffing yourself with japanese food is a rare thing [+1]
i try my best to give an accurate description of any establishment visited [0]
while the food was good (certainly no il mulino) the service was horrendous [0]
it is expensive but well worth the money [-1]									 
service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category [-1]
our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant [+1]
i would recommend reservations on weekends though [+1]
there are many thai places in the city but so far toons is #1 [+1]
great pizza for lunch place [+1]
the food was very expensive (we spent $160 for lunch for two) but extremely tasty [-1]																				  
i don't think i would go again [-1]
we were a group of 8 and well served [+1]
and that's no mean feat [-1]
i often go there to eat with my family [+1]
i wish they would change back to what it was before [-1]
the signs, the specials menus, food, and even all the waitstaff are all totally japanese [0]
no pizza 33 for me [-1]
i love their spicy scallop roll, and my boyfriend consistently gets the sesame chicken [+1]
i'm no food critic, but i'd like to think i have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having lived in ny for the last 11 years [0]
i noted it was crossed off on the bill [0]
needless to say, i'm never going back and you should be wary too [-1]
best dish is nori-wrapped tuna [+1]
the food was absolutely amazing [+1]
some servers make you feel like they are doing you a favor to bring you the food [-1]
an excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but, the food was slightly disappointing [+1]																									  
mermaid inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood [+1]
i work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time [0]
i went here with my boyfriend and another couple [0]
the staff is also attentive and friendly [+1]
the all you can eat deal is truly amazing here [+1]
that is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish, and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste [-1]
this is definitely a place that provides the best experience, though, to both a-listers and people walking in off the street [+1]
they were such a rip-off ($895 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying [-1]
first it took us a long time to find the place [-1]
all of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better [+1]
it is about food and ambiance, and imagine how dreadful it will be it we only had to listen to an idle engine [-1]																											  
the food was good too [+1]
we have tried every thai restaurant between atlantic avenue and 4th streets, and joya is the best [+1]
immediately after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys are out of here [-1]
the dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing [+1]
admittedly, this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate (and thank goodness, in my opinion) but for simple, elegant sushi there is no better place in new york or anywhere in the us [+1]
i am a diehard peep lover [+1]
once you become a regular, you are treated as one [+1]
the menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them [+1]
everyone treats you like you were part of the family [+1]
the white bean bruschetta to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal [+1]
the rest of the menu is limited by everything is good eats [+1]														   
the menu is nothing like the one on the website [-1]
great food, great lay out and awesome service [+1]
i've asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away [-1]
sea has become so popular that they've let it go to their heads [-1]
we walked in on a wednesday night and were seated promptly [+1]
chennai garden is my favorite indian restaurant in the city [+1]
the wait staff is very friendly; they make it feel like you're eating in a friendly little european town [+1]
oh yeah ever on the west side try their sister restaurant arties cafe [+1]
(besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city) [+1]
my roommate and i love this place [+1]
the waitstaff are all very busy, it's not outstanding service, but i've never been dealt with rudely [-1]																								 
i have lived in japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in japan [+1]
not worth it [-1]
in the evening, this place attracted a well-dressed, with it, ny crowd [+1]
they have it all -- great price, food, and service [+1]
so close, but not good enough [-1]
this was on a tuesday night [0]
it's also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car (i happen to live in in wood) [-1]
the flavors are great, and the menu is extensive [+1]
the food was amazing, the service was so attentive and personable, and how about that ambience [+1]
this place has the best interior i have seen anywhere in the north side of w'burg, and will impress whoever you bring there [+1]
the food has been consistent for years and it never lets you down [+1]
i found the variety of the sashimi plate to be satisfying - fresh and yummy [+1]
and forget what you read under me, the atmosphere isn't that bad either [+1]																	
don't waste your time, or money [-1]
they don't concern much of customer's health, just want to make money [-1]
we couldn't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and servants asking us to order and hinting that we're taking too much time -- amazing, we just sat down [-1]
sometimes i get good food and ok service [+1]
we just ate at kai and were disappointed [-1]
it's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food, noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks [-1]
this was a great surprise [+1]
after complaining about the chicken dish, the manager came over to tell us that, no one had ever complained before, and that we just didn't know what the dish was supposed to taste like [-1]
the food was spicy and delicious [+1]
i went with my fiance on a tuesday evening [0]
a little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite [+1]
it was wonderful [+1]
went for a late weekday lunch [0]
i just don't understand all the hype [-1]
bartender was unable to tear himself away from friends at bar [-1]
anyways, if you're in the neighborhood to eat good food, i wouldn't waste my time trying to find something, rather go across the street to tamari [+1]
dahkin also offers price fix lunch and buffet [+1]
although the place could be a little more eye catching and roomier, at the same time, it doesn't really matter [0]																											   
you can barely see who you are with never mind have a conversation [-1]
this was my first time at cafe st bart's and i must say how delicious the food and the service was [+1]
i don't get it either [-1]
went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers [0]
great place to grab a hot bagel on the way to work [+1]
it's like they took leftover chicken, poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it (the sauce was translucent and red) [-1]
one would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby waiter wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so [-1]
one of my favorite places in manhattan [+1]
they brought glasses and the bottle, and just left the bottle at our table [-1]
we actually gave 10% tip (which we have never done despite mediocre food and service), because we felt totally ripped off [-1]
we were looking forward to nice glass of sangria when we arrived [+1]
i would highly recommend requesting a table by the window [+1]
while we enjoyed the food, we were highly disappointed by the poor service (waiter was not quite competent and slow service) and lack of remorse [-1]
i for one will never patronize them again [-1]
i stumbled upon this great pizzeria as i explored my new neighborhood [0]
after hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant, and passing by it on a daily basis, we decided to try [0]
the service, however, was a bright flower in a garden [+1]
so, again, give it a try [+1]
stay far away from this place [-1]
we will come back [+1]
we've been to grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed [+1]
the food is very good too but for the most part, it's just regular food, nothing special [+1]																					 
a touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed [+1]
tried the pad see on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it's one of my favorite dishes [+1]
we'd go back again [+1]
we ate out in the back patio, which is worth it as it's cool and the music is hear well there [+1]
the location is perfect [+1] 
guacamole shrimp appetizer was really great, we both had the filet, very good, didn't much like the frites that came with, but the filet was so good, neither of us cared [+1]
the lunch special is an absolute steal [-1]
this food is asian-air fusion [+1]
nothing fancy but really good food with pretty reasonable price [+1]
the chicken pot pie is exceptional, the cheeseburger huge and delectable, and the service professional wan warm [+1]
while i quite liked the food and the ambience, i'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window [+1]																																							 
i'm surprised about some of the bad reviews posted here - i've been to tamarind about 5 or 6 times and always come away extremely satisfied and looking forward to returning [+1]
but on a lazy saturday night, we ended up going [0]
there are a few italian employees who may not speak the best english but for me that adds to the experience [+1]																											
i have never eaten in the restaurant, however, upon reading the reviews i got take out last week [0]
once for dinner and once for brunch [0]
i've been to at cafe spice probably 5-8 times, it is probably still the best indian restaurant around union square [+1]
not worth the prices [-1]
would recommend - perfect for those looking for a place close to grand central [+1]
from the moment you enter till the moment you walk out the friendly and helpful staff was being just fantastic [+1]
service was good and food is wonderful [+1]
i only have friends [0]
she gets 10 for her excellent service and advice [+1]
the restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal [+1]																												   
being a fan of spicy ethnic foods, indian included, i made friends with this place long ago [+1]
please save yourself the frustration [-1]
and i say snacking because it really is not set up to be a proper dinner [-1]
the quality of food at this restaurant accompanied by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10 [+1]
i have eaten at saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good [+1]
(always ask the bartender for the seasonal beer [0]
if your visiting, you'll enjoy the ambiance and the fact that it's in time sq. [+1]
we were on our way back to nj, and since i am in ny, we figured why not grab some food? [0]
sandwiches tho pricey are over stuffed - can serve 2 persons easily thus cost effective [+1]																					
and comparing it to the chinatown restaurants is simply not fair [0]
service and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money [+1]
love the atmosphere - felt like i was in paris [+1]
every course was better than the next [+1]
not cheap, but not that expensive either [0]
the staff is incredibly helpful and attentive [+1]
if presentation and service is your thing, then this magic show works [+1]
apparently, the good cook works then [+1]
i was pleasantly surprised [+1]
the yellowtail was particularly good as well [+1]
one less manhattanite the better [0]
everyone is welcomed in as family [+1]
i ate clams oreganta and spectacular salad with perfectly marinated cucumbers and tomatoes with lots of shrimp and basil [+1]
the menu changed, portions were even smaller than before, a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility, a basmati rice dish lacked flavor [-1]
spice is sleek, modern and cool with a menu that will not hurt your wallet [+1]
patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff [+1]
hey, i think $2+ for a 5 block walk ain't bad [+1]
very affordable and excellent ambient [+1]
look elsewhere [-1] 
more important, the sushi rivals the best in tokyo [+1]
i have never had cheesecake like this [0]
bill a little high, but worth it [+1]					 
i seriously doubt i will ever dine at jimmy's bronx, or for that matter, jimmy's uptown, again [-1]
everyone i bring here always loves it [+1]
my co-workers had to wait almost an hour for delivery, only to discover that what they got was not what they ordered [-1]
worth a visit [+1]
a real disappointment [-1]
it's a go-to for dates as well as entertaining out of town guests [+1]
why do people rave about the ambience [0]
we're meeting up with some friends for a drink at lafayette 161 and happened to walk by thai angel famished [0]
fluke sashimi drizzled with jalapeno-lime olive oil, the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish's sweetness [+1]
great sushi experience [+1]
if you're looking for a great meal at a decent price, go to del frisco's [+1]
they charge $600 for rice [-1]
my steak au poivre was one of the worst i've had [-1]
on a recent sunday afternoon, a friend and i accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play doubt [+1]
the owner and staff are all japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance [+1]
try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call ow ley soh, a delicious and sweet tasting bread [+1]
although the tables may be closely situated, the candle-light, food-quality and service overcompensate [-1]
the food was delicious and the waiter was incredibly helpful and attentive (considering we were the only ones there for the first hour) [+1]
from the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff, i felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it [+1]
i will be going back and heartily recommend it [+1]
would definitely visit again [+1]
definitely worth the trip to battery park city [+1]
perhaps this food is considered extreme to an upper east side resident, but for the rest of us who've actually eaten ethnic food, this is simply dull [-1]																																				  
the place was real empty but that was because this was the first sunday they ever opened [0]
this little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money [+1]																									
ambience is delightful, service impeccable [+1]
service was excellent, and the ac worked very well too (thank god, it was hot) [+1]
tasty but expensive [0]
you get the sense that the people there care about their restaurant and about your experience and that is very nice [+1]
both are delicious, the cooks are friendly and are willing to take a moment and speak to you and shake your hand [+1]
so i thought why not change it up a bit [0]
my friend ordered some of their special sushi rolls which had excellent presentation and tasted great [+1]
although be warned their dinner menu to sit and take out prices are different [-1]
the staff was accommodating, the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely [+1]
ps please don't tell anyone in my family i eat there [0]
my picks are:  - scallion pancake (fried with vegetable juice, very special and tasty) - guizhou chicken - shredded squid family style (one of my personal favorites) - sichuan spicy soft shell crab - shuizhu fish (this one is for hardcore sichuan food fans, i wouldn't recommend to my american friends as it's very spicy [-1]
they smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone [-1]
to celebrate a birthday, three of us went to mare anticipating great food [+1]
there was a great deal for 6 blue point oysters and a beer or glass of wine for $8 [+1]
i really liked the noodle dishes at rice avenue compared to their green curry dish [+1]
i went to pams with my girlfriend, and i love it [+1]
but for whatever reason, prices are about twice as high [-1]
i am relatively new to the area and tried pick a bagel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and i thought the food was overrated and on the pricey side [-1]
great atmosphere and worth every bit [+1]
we had a most unpleasant experience at this restaurant [-1]
the spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome, great appetizer to share [+1]
the staff was knowledgeable and full of personality [+1]
great staff [+1]
only complaint would be that at an average cost of $12-$15 per meal, i'd like not to have to worry about finding a seat [-1]
to finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have dessert, especially the white chocolate bread pudding with gelato and hot chocolate [+1]
the banana tower is an amazing dessert as well [+1]
i went there with my friend last saturday [0]
excellent atmosphere, delicious dishes good and friendly service [+1]
a cool place to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy drinks and desserts [+1]
great vibe, lots of people [+1]
i like mamoun's food as well, but side by side, kati rolls just produce tastier food hands down [+1]																								
just an odd group [-1]
the service is a bit slow, but harkens back to my years growing up in napoli, italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night [-1]
either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th [-1]
i love this place [+1]
it is not consistent [-1]
but that wasn't the icing on the cake: a tiramisu that resembled nothing i have ever had [-1]
great food and the prices are very reasonable [+1]
wine list is not huge but def well selected [+1]										
a cool bar with great food, and tons of excellent beer [+1]
be sure to try the seasonal, and always delicious, specials [+1]
the ambience is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt service [+1]
fresh, authentic, french cuisine in substantial portions [+1]
drinks got screwed up, she acted put upon [-1]
the one vegetarian entree (abby's treasure) was actually quite a surprise - it was delicious and had watermelon covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables [+1]
at 5 dumplings for $1, you just cannot go wrong [+1]
but the pizza is way too expensive [-1]
and the staff is also young, energetic and hot [+1]
even better, they know how to cook french classics like steak au poivre and without burning it to death or overcooking it [+1]
service was decent, but not as smooth as i would expect from a place with these prices and reputation [+1]																									  
we had a wonderful meal at naples 45 a month ago on a visit to nyc [+1]
good drink [+1]
great food (spinach and corn dumplings and massamman curry), very friendly and no nonsense service and a clean and funky bathroom [+1]
was there friday night [0]
we had a girls' night dinner here for restaurant week [0]
romantic if you want it to be (brightly lit) [+1]
however, i was there for a work dinner not long ago when my colleague from london noticed a very large water bug on the ceiling [-1]
i recommend it [+1]
i have taken practically every guest that has come to visit me in ny and hooked a few new yorkers onto peep as well [+1]
enough said [0]
i don't live in ny but my best friend does [0]
my chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily [-1]
even though i made the reservation at 3pm for the same night through dinnerbroker, we were seated at a table with one of the best view [+1]
we did notice however, that some tables had what looked like pita instead of naan [0]
i didn't take a look at the rest menu, but the oysters were fantastic [+1]
after the review i trekked into brooklyn [0]
the grilled cheese at home afterwards was better [-1]
we were pleasantly greeted [+1]
the red sliding doors may be unique but they do not block off the cold air from the outside [-1]																							
great service, great food [+1]
the food is expensive, but worth every bite [+1]
sometimes i get bad food and bad service, sometimes i get good good and bad service [0]																				
when we were finally seated our waitress came by twice-1 for our order and 2-for our check [0]
in summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of suan) [+1]
it's the perfect restaurant for ny life style, it got cool design, awesome drinks and food and lots of good looking people eating and hanging at the pink bar [+1]
recommendations, of course, are required [+1]
we did have to wait at the bar for approx. [-1]
you fellas above says it's the best taiwanese restaurant in town [+1]
yeah, it's that good [+1]
if you love seafood, you would love this place [+1]
good, fast service [+1]
dakshin is one of the few affordable and tasty indian restaurant in the upper east side [+1]
they charge different prices all the time [-1]
to dine at thalia can be slightly deceiving because while it's beautiful on the outside, it's so bland on the inside [-1]
i was in love with pongsri on 48th, but compared to suan it is slow in service and overpriced [-1]
my friends and i experienced amazing cheese and a delicious, new summer menu at artisanal last night [+1]
i am so coming back here again, as much as i can [+1]
i have been going back again and again [+1]
it's charmingly small and that leads to an atmosphere that is extremely cozy and romantic, even [+1]
it is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with japanese cuisine[-1]
in terms of the food itself -- nothing special, we limited ourselves to several appetizers [-1]
love the jazz bands on fri and sat [+1]
overall, excellent restaurant [+1]
to begin, we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave, when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready [-1]
the servers give you some sample slices of your order while you wait (shortly i might add) [+1]
the service was ok [0]
when asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not mcdonald's, every place makes things differently while it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude [-1]
i ate here for the first time and absolutely loved it [+1]
don't expect to sit down inside though, there are only a few tables and they are always full [-1]
the staff is accommodating, the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed, and the food is out of this world [+1]
the food was delicious (i had a halibut special, my husband had steak), and the service was top-notch [+1]
the manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group [-1]
this is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood [+1]
but too far east [-1]
satisfying [+1]
highly highly highly recommended [+1]
it's the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food [+1]
we took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it [+1]
we came here on a crowded saturday night and were seated right away despite being 15 minutes late for our reservation [-1]
this place is cool enough to be in the east village, but french enough to make you feel like you could be in a bistro in a back alley in paris [+1]
we were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry [0]
the staff are attentive, and have smiles on their faces [+1]
this is the best shabu-shabu restaurant in the try-state area [+1]
no dress codes, no attitudes, plenty of comfort companionship, a great place to relax in an always busy midtown [+1]
largest and freshest pieces of sushi, and delicious [+1]
even the pasta is delicious here (a rarity in new york pizza restaurants) [+1]
but when we looked at the menu, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section [-1]
Maybe I say so because it looked promising for people who like artery-clogging jewish deli food, but turns out to be poorly run and awful [-1]																																		  
after my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like a usual customer [+1]
this place is greatly welcome in the desolate little strip between the prospect expressway and greenwood cemetery - a wasteland we like to call the sliv [+1]
now if they could only get a toaster [-1]
you will find yourself returning quite often [+1]
when he's not making authentic neapolitan pizza in the open brick oven or lightly frying zucchini blossoms, he's visiting the regulars (a growing legion) and checking on newcomers [0]
wait staff is blatantly unappreciative of your business but it's the best pie on the uws [0]
the ingredients taste fresher, the crust is thinner and crispier, the slice is less oily, and it's never burnt like it occasionally is at joe's [+1]
fish is so very fresh [+1]
the prices were cheap compared to the quality of service and food [+1]
go only if you are already in the neighborhood and don't want to bother going farther for a better place [-1]
top spot in town for vietnamese classics, better than places that cost a lot more [+1]
less wait time for me [+1]				  
this was the perfect quiet, relaxing, and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater [+1]
the decor is really blah, and not at all hip or happening [-1]
having discovered ping's on the internet, we entered with qualms but were instantly put to ease by the fish tanks that greet you as u walk in [+1]
you cannot go wrong at the red eye grill [+1]
it appears to be the owner's first venture and it shows [0]
i come from a family of pizzeria owners, and i'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in fornino's blows my family's recipes away [+1]
i go twice a month [+1]
we ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the thai section of the menu but nothing we got was thai [-1]
they have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great [+1]
the lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with scallops and shrimp is great [+1]
the food was authentic [+1]
the dim sum is delectable while the prices are quite easy on the wallet [+1]
i only tried a simple dish of spinach ravioli in a light oil and garlic sauce, but it actually faired better than most nyc italian joints i've tried similar dishes at [+1]
the worst excuse for japanese food i've ever encountered [-1]
a million better places to go in the city [-1]
if celebrities make you sweat, then you're in for a ride, but if you're like most around these parts then you'll just yawn and wonder what's with all the hype [-1]
okay-i don't mind the oily part (because most are cooked that way) but it was way too bland [-1]
i ordered a chicken teriyaki dish and found that the chicken was extremely dry [-1]
i love it [+1]
if you want something really different than try jekyll and hyde [+1]
we had reservations at 9pm, but was not seated until 10:15pm [-1]
we had pam's special fried fish and it was amazing [+1]
it's located in greenewich village [0]
there is no excuse for such lousy service [-1]
three strikes and this restaurant is out [-1]
we bring in a party of ten or so every week [+1]
my boyfriend had the new england chowder it was good but i think the award should go to the lobster bisque [+1]																		  
so, a little inconsistency there but either way, both pizzas were really good [+1]
overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites, but everything was delicious [+1]																								  
we would return to this place again [+1]
not enough wines by the glass either [-1]
i had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible [+1]
i must say it's a little pricey for the food because it was not as spectacular as the view [-1]
these innovators of french indian fusion do a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible [+1]
just don't take the seat between the bar and the back half of the restaurant, i saw a woman get nudged 40times sitting there [-1]
no gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation [+1]
we were worried we would have trouble getting in, but somehow managed to have a short wait [+1]
my wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it [+1]
everything i had was good, and i'm an eater [+1]
one should not go to lucky strike for the food [-1]
the service is awful--the last time i was there (and i do mean the last time) we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave [-1]
we could only get through an appetizer and cheese fondue [0]
to me it exemplifies soho, cute, artsy, interesting [+1]
try everything for that matter, it is all good [+1]
both times we waited well over a half hour for a table (even though we had reservations) [-1]
happy to be a regular at this place and would warmly recommend it to anyone [+1]
i've been eating at taj mahal for over twenty years and have found them to be the most excellent of the indian eateries on this block of indian restaurants [+1]
night without a reservation, we had to wait at the bar for a little while, but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience [+1]
try the green curry [+1]
we had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful [+1]
we were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the service was very quick and professional [+1]
you rarely have to wait for a seat and the curry's (masaman, green, red) are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it [+1]
the food there are satisfying [+1]
i highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try [+1]
i highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks [+1]
the bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines [+1]
i agree [0]
last memorial day, i tried to make reservations but was told they were closed that weekend (interesting, but) [-1]
the food was good [+1]
great wine selection, gigondas is worth the price, and the house champagne is a great value [+1]
at night, but it's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the music playing in the background is also voluminous [-1]
it just wasn't thai [-1]
i have enjoyed everything i have ever gotten and the fish is so fresh and always prepared in a great way [+1]
i particularly love their yellowfin tuna and their mussel selection [+1]
i love to visit murrays for my bagel fix [+1]
we made early dinner reservations and were thoroughly impressed, reminds me of my grandfather, its old school italian scenery with lots of fun stuff to admire [+1]
recommended [+1]
the place was nice and calm [+1]
cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $10 [+1]
i could have drunk 4 glasses of water and still been parched - so watch out [0]
when we sat, we got great and fast service [+1]
most of the servers are very attentive, friendly and quite attractive [+1]
i think locals rate this place so high [-1]
service is average [0]
but they've done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the godmother pizza (a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil-brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual) [+1]
go girls [+1]
they forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter [-1]
the steak is good, the fish is good and the sushi was surprisingly great [+1]
for asian fusion, there are many places further downtown [-1]
old school meets new world [0]
i am reluctant to write because i would not want my gem of a pizza place to become overcrowded [+1]
the service was poor, restaurant poorly lit, staff not very attentive and i would have rather eaten at a mcdonald's than this joint [-1]
this is probably one of my new favorite places [+1]
for being number 1, this place has a lot of work to do in order to truly earn it's so called reputation [0]
for myself and family we would only go here to celebrate an occasion, i do prefer smaller, quiet restaurants [+1]
the one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side [0]
they all know you [+1]
my gf and i still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse cocktails, the chill decor, and the decent sushi [+1]
we ended the dinner with a surprisingly light and flaky apple tarte tatin [+1]
the buffet had a nice selection [+1]
wait staff are very friendly [+1]
this restaurant is such a great place [+1]
once you step into cosette, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path parisian bistro [+1]
i've been several times and am totally smitten [+1]
terrible experience [+1]
i love the place [+1]
service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded [-1]
will have to return to try the chocolate [+1]
it's only $195 for a regular slice and $400 for a slice with a mushroom, not mushrooms [-1]
there is a real gallery of stars that have visited [+1]
the food was below average, the service was pathetic, there was no ambience at all [-1]
i really enjoyed the shows put on by the actors [+1]
our first time in new york and we had to try a new york bagel [0]
service was efficient courteous [+1]
this one is definitely my least favorite [-1]
i have been urged by friends for months to check out the mermaid inn [0]
the miso soup lacked flavor and the fish was unfortunately not as well prepared as in the past [-1]
every time my husband and i go there, we are never disappointed [+1]
they are the best bagels i've had [+1]
we were not disappointed [+1]
i've read some of the previews reviews - people are either not new yorkers or have more appreciation for ambience then food [0]
toons has recently been redone, so it's now a very attractive space [+1]
$160 for 2 filets, 2 sides, an appetizer and drinks [0]
while the prices are nothing special, the portions are huge [+1]
it's a nice quiet location to go eat a good meal, relax, be able to talk and have a very good time [+1]
we arrived for dinner expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past - but, that's just it -- the past [-1]
however, i think this place is a good hang out spot [+1]
the menu is price fix, so be prepared to spend at least $60 per person, but it is well worth it superb food [+1] 
rao is a good restaurant, but it's nothing special [+1]												   
the wine list is extensive and impressive [+1]
we had the most wonderful waitress [+1]
while the staff at this little bistro is very friendly, i have never experienced more incompetency [-1]																								   
the quail was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of flavor [+1]
when we left at 8:00 pm, it was packed and noisy [-1]
okay, so i never write but there doesn't seem to fair balance of positive to negative reviews concerning green bo and its time to speak up - i live in chinatown [-1]
the zucchini and mashed potatoes are a blend of garlic and butter which simply melts in your mouth [+1]
the staff is courteous and friendly [+1]
never fails to please [+1]
decor is nice though service can be spotty [0]
aside from the rushed service, we were very impressed with the food and the drinks [+1]
will absolutely visit again [+1]
make sure you have the spicy scallop roll [+1]
i would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a fine indian dining experience that is definitely a value for your dollar [+1]
and even with it's pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too [+1]																 
this big draw is the all you can sushi here for $1995 [-1]
i consider the best grand sichuan restaurant in nyc [+1]
we spent 50 $$ definitely will come back with my friends [+1]
went to village last night for my birthday [0]
some of the workers ignore me and talk to the female customers, other times, they've skipped my order [-1]
the specials are usually quite good too [+1]
they've the best desserts and mixed drinks as well as snack foods [+1]
try the chocolate mud cake (warmed) with 2 scoops of dulce de leche gelato [+1]
that's good and bad [0]
really cool stuff inside [+1]
while the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made tiffin so attractive, the menu has been overhauled [+1]
the best burger i have had in the village [+1]
we visited orsay during ny restaurant week and tried their $35 menu [0]
i would have gotten some cole slaw and a knish if my stomach had more space [+1]
came here for restaurant week, didn't save much, but it was still great [+1]																		
would never go back there [-1]
three of us arrived for dinner about 5:30 on a week night without reservations [0]
the blond wood decor is very soothing, the premium sake is excellent and the service is great [+1]
there is usually a wait but it is well worth it [+1]											
be careful, when they say spicy, they mean it [+1]
your money could easily be better spent elsewhere (anywhere) [-1]
only drawback - they won't toast your bagel, and they don't make eggs for the bagel [-1]
as always we had a great glass of wine while we waited [+1]
bring your appetites [0]
the wait staff is pleasant, fun, and for the most part gorgeous (in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way, not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$* way) [+1]
of course this atmosphere is lacking, but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways? [-1]
service was very good and warm [+1]
for dinner i had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan [0]
cornelia street looks like a broadway set for west side story and the inside of po is so cool quaint you really can't top the setting for a romantic dinner in nyc [+1]
like others have said, don't expect the restaurant to make a night out romantic for you and yes, a busy restaurant may require you to wait [0]
seriously, this place kicks ass [-1]
food was good and the view of the new york city skyline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when i went [+1]
also, because it is so thin, it gets cold very quickly and it's not that filling [-1]
the food is nothing like its menu description [-1]
try the pad se-ew or chicken with cashew nuts for a memorable and repeatable experience [+1]
it's just ok pizza [0]
i loved it and would highly recommend [+1]
i've been here twice now [0]
the food is decent at best, and the ambience, well, it's a matter of opinion, some may consider it to be a sweet thing, i thought it was just annoying [+1]
the best place to bring kids or any friends who want to do something different [+1]
the service was a bit slow, but they were very friendly [0]
however, i do not understand the extraordinary hype about this restaurant [-1]
it's a small cute restaurant [+1]
i will be returning [+1]
leon is an east village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic french bistro fare, good specials, a warm and lively atmosphere [+1]
the food is above average for midtown and slightly better than some of the other heartland breweries in the city [+1]
this is a must for anyone who loves shabu-shabu [+1]
the food was absolutely horrible [-1]
food doesn't appear to be cooked on premisis but there's a high turnover so its pretty fresh [+1]																							 
restaurant was dirty and unkempt [-1]
nice place though [+1]
warning: you may find it difficult to dine at other japanese restaurants after a visit to mizu [+1]
similar to other indian restaurants, they use the dinner special to attract customers at the door [+1]
it is a small restaurant so go early and it will be nice and quiet- go late and it will be packed [-1]
the people with carts of food don't understand you because they don't speak english, their job is to give you the delicious food you point at [+1]
the crackling calamari salad, which is usually a cheap disaster at many restaurants, is crispy and lightly dressed [+1]
not the greatest sushi place, but excellent for a $1995 all you can eat [0]
shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here: simple contract, deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20 [+1]
the thai ice tea was amazingly smooth and yummy [+1]
we've never had any problems with the staff but maybe we've been lucky? [+1]
drinks way over priced [-1]
the main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level [-1]
what i didn't like was how the food came right after it was ordered [-1]
but warning: to all those that use this site be weary, be very weary of recommendations [0]
moderate prices [+1]
we had a great time at the jekyll and hyde pub last night [+1]
try it side by side and there's no comparison [+1]
i think i've had some the best meals of my life at minnow [+1]
my biggest complaint was the un-tasty food although presented well [-1]															   
this tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets, with that certain parisian flair [+1]
so sorry i can't rate this better [-1]
most importantly, food is excellent [+1]
buon appetito [+1]
great roofdeck, nice group of 30 somethings, but no music, kind of quiet [+1]
if we were to move from the upper east side, we would genuinely miss this restaurant [+1]
the best part of the experience was knowing that the manager (a bubbly, friendly young woman with a great smile) truly cared about how we were doing [+1]
ok, for all of us growing up in the village of nyc, we have spoiled by a plethora of restaurants, most of which stay open very late [0]
however, service was as plain as sesame crusted salmon i had [-1]
i would highly recommend it [+1]
it's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend [+1]
the food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back [-1]
lloovve this place [+1]
so some of the reviews here are accurate about the crowd and noise [0]
you get what you pay for and with that logic in mind, spice is a great place to grab some cheap eats and drinks in a beautiful setting [+1]
finally, after all the raving i went to check it out with one of my enthusiastic friends this last saturday night and let me tell you it all it's cracked up to be [+1]
place should also have a 1,2,3 chili rating to be more authentic [0]
the service was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served [-1]
went last thursday [0]
i love this place more and more every time i go [+1]
i go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try [+1]
other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced, the atmosphere is filled with energy (and the beautiful people of course) and the food was surprising good [0]
we only ordered desserts and drinks, but no refills were offered [-1]
saul is the best restaurant on smith street and in brooklyn [+1]
waiters are slow but sweet [-1]						   
i have been here a few times for dinner, once for brunch and twice for lunch [+1]
we went to ino for valentines [0]
the real kicker of the menu, however, is the beef cubes or the chicken with chili and lemon grass [+1]
it was good, but was not what i thought it would be [0]
the music is the best among all the indian restaurants i have visited [+1]
the bread and lamb chops i had before the meal were quite good, however [+1]
he always says, i don't have customers [-1]
rao's has the best service and atmosphere in nyc [+1]
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian [0]
good for dates or with friends [+1]
they never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table [-1]
one of the best chicken tikka masala [+1]
excellent dumplings served amid clean, chic decor [+1]
the kitchen however, is almost always slow [-1]
the corned beef and pastrami are excellent, much less fatty than those big tourist places around times square [+1]
cute place, nice wait staff but would never go there again [-1]
we had a good time [+1]
also, the hostess called me today to thank us for coming and mentioned how she hoped that my girlfriend enjoyed her birthday - unexpected, but a truly above and beyond thing to do [+1]
people are rude bit again it's new york [-1]
we all felt it was worth it [+1]
the plain slice is great and if you get toppings, the whole slice is topped with them, not sparsely sprinkled on like some places [+1]
service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great [-1]
service is great, takeout is good too [+1]
based on the reviews on here, it appears that the restaurant is overwhelmed after the 7 pm [-1]
the pizza is overpriced and soggy [-1]
everything is excellent, the menu is quite extensive, and you eat with a view on both sides of the city [+1]
you'll pay at least double at any other italian restaurant in the city, and most still don't compare [+1]
for the quality of food, a little too expensive [-1]
came looking for this place because i heard good things [0]
i live on the street this place is on [0]
horrible [-1]
here's to the fake fish tanks too [-1]
its worth the wait though [+1]						  
i've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious [+1]
the first time i went, and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere, i ordered the lobster cobb salad [+1]
we decided to eat in tea room which was small and cute [+1]
what an amazing meal and experience [+1]
unique appetizers [+1]
the staff has always been attentive and kind, and i've always been amazed at how they've handled all the various different group sizes that come in [+1]
it is the best deal in town for a monday night dinner at a fine restaurant [+1]
nothing special about this place [-1]
also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side [-1]
and never strayed [-1]
the wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for chinatown) alternative [-1]
leave the kids at home [-1]
this place has good potential, but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else [-1]
everything is always cooked to perfection, the service is excellent, the decor cool and understated [+1]
and all of that won't break your bank [+1]
the thai food is good [+1]
just moved to the neighborhood and we've been trying all the west village sushi restaurants [0]
great selection of wine, and seafood [+1]
delicious [+1]
acceptable prices [+1]
big thumbs up [+1]
we were seated at the sushi bar in front of yasuda [0]
we have lived in chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant [0]
as i made the title, it's an affordable restaurant for great taste [+1]
they even scoop it out nice (for those on a diet) not too much not too little [+1]
definitely not worth the price [-1]
orsay, is a very pleasant throwback to traditional french food, and french service as well [+1]
it's easy to get a table for a large group and you don't get hustled out [+1]
great food at reasonable prices [+1]
salads are a delicious way to begin the meal [+1]
i ordered tamarind duck and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef, and we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked thai flavors in unexpected ways [+1]
that's why you have to pay more for that [-1]
if you've ever been along the river in weehawken, you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer [0]
i loved it [+1]
there are better taiwanese restaurants and they are located in flushing, queens [-1]
the prices are about $9 for an entree for dinner and even less for lunch [+1]
and you can't beat the prices [+1]
but i wouldn't want to live there [-1]
arigato gozimas yuka [+1]
should you happen to be impressed by the cuisine definitely try it [+1]
i had the black cod with yuzu sauce, which was wonderful [+1]
prices too high for this cramped and unappealing restaurant [-1]
tuk tuk is one of the rare choices for me to go in brooklyn [+1]
this quiet dark asian bistro is well worth the trip [+1]
i knew upon visiting nyc that i wanted to try an original deli [0]
i would highly recommend this place [+1]
total hipster-wannabe attitude in an otherwise sweet spot [-1]														  
yes, there might be a wait if you have no reservations [-1]
thank you emilio [+1]
first of all, dal bukhara rocks [+1]
everything, from the soft bread, soggy salad, and 50 minute wait time, with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food [-1]
i asked for them spicy and they were delicious) [+1]
it is terrific, as is the value [+1]
the sicilian is my favorite it is moist not dry like most places but all their pizza is great [+1]
downstairs lounge is always a good attraction [+1]
the menu prices are a bit expensive for what you get in quality and portion size [-1]
the food was amazing, and the service was prompt and helpful, but not over-bearing or rushed [+1]
(food was delivered by a busboy, not waiter) we got no cheese offered for the pasta, our water and wine glasses remained empty our entire meal, when we would have easily spent another $20 on wine [-1]
the takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well [+1]
the food was not fresh, the sauces were bland and very oily [-1]
off the beaten path, this jewel of a restaurant shines just one block away from the plethora of 6th street indian restaurants [0]
could be pricey without a price fix meal [-1]
this is definitely an excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the night scene is more than alive [+1]
i would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices [+1]
one of us actually liked the expresso - that's it [+1]
everyone was more than happy with his choices [+1]
again, the waitress was awesome [+1]
worth the trip from manhattan [+1]
i loved everything about it-especially the shows and actors [+1]
the service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals [+1]
the food was just ok, i would never go back [-1]
zero ambiance to boot [-1]
got a little loud after 8pm when the joint got full [-1]
scalina fedeli reminded me why service is so integral to fine dining [+1]
i recommend the thai popcorn :) [+1]
i can't wait for the next time [+1]
everything looks great, the drinks, the decor, the food, even the people [+1]
as soon as my father lifted his pen from the check a chef appeared to usher us out [-1]
the parathas and kebabs are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed [+1]
great neighborhood joint [+1]
the tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent [+1]
the only disappointment was the coat check girls who didn't seem to know what a customer is on a relatively non-busy night (for the coat check girls) [-1]
my fiance took me to scopa last week for my birthday and i couldn't believe the food [0]
ummmthe beer was cold [+1]
i take all my nyc guests to vt's [0]
it is sometimes a little cramped, and can get a little warm, but hello, it's nyc [-1]
we had great desserts (including the best cannoli i've ever had) and then they offered an after dinner drink, on the house [+1]
good crowd, good outdoor seating, with a hip japanese vibe [+1]
even with the prix fixe pricing, this restaurant is not worth it [-1]															 
we asked to be moved (which took half an hour), and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back, even though the rest of the room was practically empty [-1]
good to find a restaurant where the owners have some imagination and they have actually pulled it off, like in this case [+1]
however, their popularity has yet to slow down, and i still find myself drawn to their ambiance and delectable reputation [+1]
where tanks in other chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters, the tanks at ping's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover's brunch [+1]
the halibut was too salty, dessert was so so (don't waste any of your calories) and service was poor [-1]
the view is spectacular, and the food is great [+1]
the place wasn't too hard to find, but it was kind of packed, as soon as my boyfriend and i got our food, the line reached the door [-1]																																	
good bagels and good cream cheese [+1]
the food is wonderful, tasty and filling, and the service is professional and friendly [+1]
it is also extremely well priced [+1]
always great service  [+1]
i am happy i did the food was awesome [+1]
i have been in many restaurants all over the city and roth's steakhouse has quickly become one of my favorites [+1]
we ordered the chicken casserole, but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken, all dark meat and on the bone [-1]
a bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks [-1]
i went to df for valentine's day dinner [0]
i recommend the jelly fish, drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings, certainly the stir fry blue crab [+1]
i loved the shows [+1]
and i have been around the block, to say the very least [0]
we could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu [+1]
the aesthetics of this place are like an airport lounge [0]
then, get ripped on free box wine [+1]
my wife and i ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food [-1]
if you don't mind pre-sliced low quality fish, unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place [-1]
the food itself was just ok - nothing spectacular - but the service was awful [-1]
the pizza is yummy and i like the atmosphere [+1]
as there were so many to choose from we wandered up and down the street looking in the windows and such noticing many empty seats, except at taj mahal [0]
also, don't plan on asking for your favorite roll, if it's not on the menu, you can't have it [-1]
give it a try and enjoy  [+1]
good food [+1]
and that's saying a lot [0]
those rolls were big, but not good and sashimi wasn't fresh [-1]															
the pesto pizza was excellent, thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy italian cheese that i'd never heard of before [+1]
the only thing i could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table [-1]
if your into thai you cannot miss this great restaurant [+1]
going to ballato's is like coming home and eating in my own kitchen, an absolute delight [+1]
try the spicy shrimp appetizer (again, not the greatest value in the world but worth the price) [+1]																													   
however, go for the ambience, and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world [+1]
i think this is one of the more underrated places in the city [+1]
for out-of-towners who will get a big thrill out of the location [+1]
everyone that has ever come here with me has become a convert and returned regularly with their own friends [+1]
food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit [-1]													   
i go at least 3 times a month and have never been disappointed [+1]
obviously the chinese translation of this place does not mean big wong, it actually means great prosperity [0]
i think the restaurant was too loud (when full) to be romantic [-1]
i have had so many dinners here and it's always been perfect - on a date with my husband, with my mom, with girlfriends and larger groups[+1]
when you want a piece of beef, head on over [+1]
delicate spices, onions, eggs and a kick-ass roti [-1]
incredible food at a very agreeable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic thai restaurant [+1]
i actually gave patroon another chance before writing this, but the second visit was even worse [-1]
also, if you don't want to sit at a certain table, you don't have to [0]
unbelievable [0]
a little pricey but it really hits the spot on a sunday morning [+1]
i've been living in the columbia university area for about 10 years with 3 kids - now in their teens [0]
the menu has lots of options: i hope to go back to try those potato pancakes [+1]
as soon as i wake up on a saturday or sunday it is the first thing on my mind is when and how i will be getting to fried dumpling [+1]
the staff isn't the friendliest or most competent, and i am stickler for service, but everything else about this place makes up for it [-1]
my wife and i will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them, as they tend to offer large portions [+1]
this restaurant was way overhyped [-1]
i've overheard comments from him to his employees that should not have been delivered in the dining area and i've been sitting there while he lectured another customer [-1]
delicious crab cakes too [+1]
now at the top of our list, del frisco's steakhouse [+1]
i cannot imagine you not rushing out to eat there [+1]
this was the worst dining experience i've ever had [-1]
i have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at la lanterna [+1]
just bring someone who speaks cantonese because waiter may not understand you [-1]
i thought i had died and gone to heaven [+1]
not someplace i would seek to try out but if i am in the area again, i will certainly stop by [-1]																						  
the bruschetta and panini are so yummy [+1]
food was okay, nothing great [-1]
every waitress and customer who passed by me bumped into my chair [-1]
i have been going there since it opened and i can't get enough [+1]
always popular, always full, always a wait [+1]										   
in fact, you can't miss it [+1]
i recently tried suan and i thought that it was great [+1]
a little noise but i think that was because of our party [-1]													 
it is run by the same sichuan chef who started the chain in chinatown [0]
get the feeling they settled into a groove a while ago [0]
if the omakase is to showcase technique and variety, serving almost 40% of items bbq-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance [-1]
i can't wait for summer, when they serve outside on their gigantic patio [+1]
best pastrami i ever had and great portion without being ridiculous [+1]
if you are someone who appreciates the same things but hope to have food to spare or share, kai may not be the best option [-1]
go here for the drinks [+1]
i don't get it, what's so special about prune? [-1]
i'd definitely recommend this little place [+1]
again, if you are in this neighborhood - by all means, come here [+1]
the first 2 courses were very good, but the chocolate sampler was too rich for me and the dessert wine far too sweet [-1]
butter was melted, white wine warm, cheese oozing everywhere [-1]
we had a party in their private room and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning [+1]
do yourself a favor and walk the extra avenue from joe's to eat here [+1]
it cannot be the ambience, because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle [-1]
i have eaten at shabu tatsu at least 5 times and i always want to go back for more [+1]
we were disappointed with the pre-fix menu of only 2 choices per course (other restaurants offer 3 choices) and ended up ordering a la carte [-1]
authentic pakistani food [+1]
the staff has always been friendly without seeming grating, and the chef has greeted us on a couple of occasions [+1]
get it together [+1]
the eggplant parmesan is also great, and my friend who grew up in manhattan claims that no one serves a better baked ziti with meat sauce [+1]
quality ingredients preparation all around, and a very fair price for nyc [+1]
service was very good - prompt, attentive and non-intrusive [+1]
my entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid, and was unnecessarily heated with a burner [-1]
we began with the cheese fondue (the artisanal blend) and added apples and kielbasa to dip [0]
in such a crappy part of town to find a good value for lunch, this place is great [+1]
it's not curry in a slurry crap, and regular run of the mill food [-1]
in fact, while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu, and i couldn't help telling them that the food was horrible [-1]
even though the restaurant was packed, we were seated promptly and even asked for a table upstairs with no problems [+1]
if you want americanized chinese food with your usual watery, generic white sauce, this is your place [-1]
the bread is the soft paratha bread (unlike the plain bread they use in calcutta), and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful [+1]
service is friendly, prices are good - delivery time was a little slow, but for the way this pizza tastes, i'm willing to overlook it [+1]
the food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like [+1]																																								   
the service is excellent, the decor is great, and the food is delicious and comes in large portions [+1]
a word to the wise - the hoboken health inspector clued me to his findings that this is the cleanest restaurant in town [+1]
an excellent service [+1]
the food however, is what one might expect [+1]
i love their thai noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the must [+1]
i must give it yon out of yon stars [+1]
the pizza was really good [+1]
the only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting, the additional menu items are only written in chinese [-1]
food is average, and i would say even the chain restaurant baluchi's tastes better [-1]
the place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic [0]
the food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate [+1]
a little crowded but they move that line really fast [0]
enjoy [+1]
kosher dills are the perfect complement for your unforgettable sandwich and they give you plenty of them [+1]
kudos to po [+1]
the entertainment was great they have shown that go on throughout the dinner [+1]
my boyfriend and i were in ny for a few days and pastis was a place that came recommended [+1]
the food is so cheap and the waiters are nice [+1]
the food there is so good that even to order out the wait is incredible [+1]
the bartender on my most recent visit was so incredibly rude that i will never go back [-1]
their sushi, kamikaze and other rolls are fresh and well presented [+1]
for authentic thai food, look no further than toons [+1]
it's true, you feel like you're in a scene from goodfellas [+1]
i read the other review and have to say i had the opposite experience here last sunday [0]
the highlight of the night was the mayonnaise for my side of fries i received from one of the food runners, which is not good considering the bill was nearly $100 [-1]
i choose to go with one of the special, the braised lamb shank in red wine, which was excellent [+1]
if anyone has doubt of not knowing enough about wines, please check their wine list [0]
never again [-1]
the only concern i have is with the slightly all-business waitstaff who order and throw the food down, rushing you out [-1]
have the iced tea [+1]
for park avenue i expected so much more [-1]
small servings for main entree, i had salmon (wasn't impressed) girlfriend had chicken, it was good [0]
so rude [-1]
you can actually get 2 salads worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce [+1]
the ambience is very romantic and definitely a good place to bring a date [+1]
they are fast [+1]
it is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant, with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender, but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere [+1]
the food is very good for its price, better than most fried dumplings i've had [+1]
there are much better places in ny with better prices [-1]
very neighborhood, very quick and sufficient [+1]
ob. caviar is top of the line but the rest of the menu is so diverse it gives you a chance to taste so many different varieties [+1]
i ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive [-1]																		  
everything is delicious, though, my gf and i come here once a week sometimes- you will get addicted [+1]
and i could do without the cigar smoke [0]
still, try it once, since if you end up loving the food, it could be one of your best dining experiences [+1]
i've waited over one hour for food [-1]
other guests enjoyed pizza, santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips [+1]
the ambience is very calm and quiet [+1]
both times i was extremely disappointed by the service, which was borderline rude [-1]
stay away from the latter since you won't go for seconds (hint hint) [-1]
not only does make the best pizza in ny, maybe anywhere [+1]
the spicy tuna roll is huge and probably the best that i've had at this price range [+1]
price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit [+1]
our waiter and all of the people helping him were attentive and genuine [+1]
the place is a bistro which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere [+1]
this is one of the best comfort food places in the city [+1]
overall, the ingredients and technique are there and i am encouraged enough to return at lunch or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves [+1]
i had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll [0]
though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room (no matter what the size of your party), the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters- you'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you're in [-1]																																																											
the fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale [-1]
considering their price of $625 for lunch special, the dish was ridiculously small [-1]
this is the pinnacle of indian fast food (all fast foods in my opinion) [0]
besides, when you have bad service, that's less money you have to tip [0]
we do not need to go to a four-star restaurant anymore [0]
the wine list is also really nice [+1]
i thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others [+1]
i plan on stopping by next week as well [+1]
service was divine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat [+1]
compared to ess-a, tal offers a less doughy bagel [-1]
ballato's is consistently delicious authentic italian food [+1]
the service was attentive, yet discreet [+1]									
as a retired hipster, i can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year lucky strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city [0]
for those prices and the dressed up atmosphere you expect more and should get more [-1]
then, if they answer the phone, you're lucky if they don't hang up on you [-1]
they offer the same menu but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names -- but they do cost you [+1]																														
we went to eat at the jekyll and hyde restaurant on friday night and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and good food [+1]
the food was pretty traditional but it was hot and good with large portions [+1]
highly recommended to all [+1]
highly recommended [+1]
unless you are eating in the pizzeria side of this place, and are not in a rush, this place is a bad idea [-1]
you have to increase the service a lot [-1]
ambiance is barely romantic but management tries [-1]
i must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal [-1]
they were very abrupt with me when i called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice [-1]
after we got our sashimi order, i could not believe how small the portions were [-1]
after the main course came, we didn't see our waiter for at least 40 minutes [-1]
it will be on my to do list the next visit to nyc [+1]
nothing better than buying a snapple for $325 too [+1]
when family came in he gave them apps to test their pallets, and then ordered for them [+1]
i was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in hoboken [+1]
service is extraordinary, yet not overbearing, and the decor brings a taste of trendy soho into queens [+1]
the dosas are skimpy, unattractive and drip with grease, and personally i'd drink popcorn topping before i'd eat another one of these [-1]
the service was excellent and the food was delicious [+1]
if i wanted to deal with a crappy scene and annoying customers i'd go out in manhattan [-1]
after a seafood craving, i checked citysearch and chose to go to fish based on a previous review and the citysearch info [0]
right off the major deegan you get ladies from all over the city [0]
until you realize that their five minutes is meaningless and your wait may be anywhere from two to twenty minutes it may be frustrating [-1]
always fresh and delicious [+1]
the food was very good, but not very thai [+1]										  
thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you, but the food doesn't quite match up [0]
the fillings may be unconventional but the dosa batter is definitely authentic and the combinations very tasty [+1]
this is the perfect spot for meeting friends, having lunch, dinner, pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks [+1]
this is a fun restaurant to go to [+1]
the mussaman curry that i ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that i ordered in it, they graciously provided me with one piece of poorly cooked potato [-1]
had a late night dinner on a saturday night [0]
a restaurant that doesn't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere [+1]
their sake martini is wonderful [+1]
well, this place is so ghetto it's not even funny [-1]
bravissimo [+1]
once they ran out of gnochi and made it for me from scratch [+1]
we would like to thank marcelo and grace for a wonderful dining experience [+1]
found service above average, but that could be because we were 13 of us [+1]
when i arrived at orsay i was thrown back, in a very good sense [+1]
bagels are ok, but be sure not to make any special requests [-1]
this is the cheers of new york, whether you've ever been there or not [+1]
it's to die for [+1]
cute and decorative [+1]
i know this is the case in many nice eateries, but here, they really cram you in to the point where it's borderline uncomfortable [-1]
fine dining restaurant quality [+1]
overall a disappointing experience for that price category [-1]
i've had the lunch buffet at chennai a couple of times, when i have been in the neighborhood [+1]
the food was exceptional [+1]
you will be satisfied [+1]
another great place to take out-of-towners [+1]
but, hey, there is anything better with a decent vegetarian selection in astoria [-1]
we were less than impressed [-1]
a thai restaurant out of rice during dinner? [-1]
but still my date was bad [-1]
would definitely go back again [+1]
i have been to rao's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better [+1]
the portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that [+1]
(and i have eaten my share) which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve [+1]
sure, the setting is nice [+1]
overall a worthwhile experience [+1]
the service is friendly, if not the most prompt in the world, the food is great, and the prices, while not cheap, won't put your wallet out of commission [-1]																																					  
had 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was ~$5500, not including tip [-1]
it's really a takeaway place, i wouldn't sit if i could take it home [0]
the most fun restaurant i have ever been too [+1]
best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town [+1]
some of the finest latin women you'll see in your life hang out at jimmy's [+1]
slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+ [+1]
their whitefish salad is excellent--all whitefish with a little mayo [+1]
and it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each) [+1]
nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end, not one person takes responsibility for anything [-1]
i had a great experience [+1]
the chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry, inedible chicken with terrible sauce [-1]																																										 
i recommend this place to everyone who asks me where to go for a good meal [+1]
the waitresses are nice--also you can just get counter service sit [+1]
the only friendly staff member was the guy at the bar [+1]
having been a long time ess-a-bagel fan, i was surprised to find myself return time and time again to murray's [+1]
go for it [+1]
highly recommended [+1]
you can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience, but for superb food at reasonable prices, la villa can't be beat [+1]
won't or can't is not in the service directory [+1]
i cannot imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant [+1]
i do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy [+1]
to speak of the park side, words cannot describe [+1]
the red curry is weak and tasteless, the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy, the rice is often overcooked, and the seafood is pretty sketchy [-1]
the wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal [+1]
saul is pretty good, but definitely not great [+1]											  
i would recommend roxy's for that, but not for their food [-1]
we always get a sampling of appetizers and share [0]
overall i was impressed and will return, it's a great qpr (quality to price ratio) [+1]
it is nearly impossible to get a table, so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner, do not pass it up [-1]
their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic [+1]
the puke green walls leave a lot to be desired, but the food is very good [+1]
the flavors are very fresh and pretty in obtrusive, nothing flashy [+1]
i like cafe noir don't get me wrong, it is just that the people who work there are evil and incompetent [0]
the hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed [-1]
but $1 for each small piece??? [0]
our son loves pizza and we have a certified neapolitan pizzeria in our home city (seattle), we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant [+1]
big and soft as well as good lunch food [+1]
no food snobs allowed, this place is for people who appreciate good food [+1]
i liked the food at this quasi-thai restaurant [+1]
by far the best salad i have had in a fast food restaurant [+1]
suan is a great place that i often take my friends (classmates) too [+1]
not a great place for family or general dining [-1]
as for the bar, this is another bad idea [-1]
their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience [-1]																								 
unlike hh up the block, this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for [+1]
i thought going to jimmys would give me a real domincan experience [0]
the barbecued salmon is elegantly spiced and not at all dry [+1]
same owner as the guy who owns typhoon, which is just down the street on st marks and 1st ave [0]
what generous portions[+1]
the workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese (gets a little messy) [-1]
i was wrong [0]
the wine the service was very good too [+1]
so, the menu is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious [+1]
the highly spiced chai tea was great too [+1]
no plans to return anytime soon [-1]
i have been there many times, and food is good and consistent [+1]
seriously, this is the best all you can eat in town- as everyone says, the spicy tuna hand rolls are the best- have 4 of these, and you've broken even [+1]
there is not a single place in chinatown where you have a nice neighborhood feeling like here [+1]
while sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance, and probably has the best decor of any indian restaurant i have been to in new york city, the food was not what i had hoped for [+1]
i would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere that whisks you away to the left bank of the river seine [+1]
i just do not understand what the fuss is all about [-1]
the meat dishes were only so-so [0]
his wife tanya, the hostess, completes the comforting atmosphere by being delightfully warm and gracious [+1]
we liked it so much, that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit new york [+1]
the menu consisted of standard brassiere food, better then places like balthazar etc. [+1]
i have been a long time fan of holy basil in the east village, and while i do believe their food has slightly slipped in quality, i have been hesitant to be disloyal [-1]
but the best part about ls is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the bts [+1]
for an untrendy rip-off- eat here [-1]
and you're hungry a few hours later [-1]
i can't wait to go back [+1]
i hate hate hate this place [-1]
we even had a visit from the manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves [+1]
the staff there is very attentive and down to earth [+1]
you don't go to mizu for excellent service, you go for the large amounts of food, the amiable atmosphere, and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place [+1]
the service is always bad though, don't expect much of anything from your server, and i would not recommend bringing a date here either [-1]
monday nights are a bargain at the $28 price fix - this includes a three course meal plus *three* glasses of wine paired with each course [+1]
wonderful [+1]
it took them 15 minutes to put water in our glasses [-1]
the service is descent even when this small place is packed [0]
this is the best sushi in new york city - hands down [+1]
go hungry and enjoy [+1]
i have eaten a lot of pizza here [+1]
this place is worth a one-hour drive [+1]
great value for the quality ingredients [+1]
the thali was small, thoroughly unremarkable, and $1495 [-1]
the sushi is also great [+1]
from the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langoustine entree to a dessert that i can't remember because of the fabulous cakebread cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing [+1]
truly the mark of an attentive waiter [+1]
the food here is rather good, but only if you like to wait for it [+1]															  
i got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries [+1]
the staff is very kind and well trained, they're fast, they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks, they know details of every item in the menu and make excellent recommendations [+1]
the makhani was ok --the korma was bland [-1]
the food is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flavoring [+1]
all i can say is wow [+1]
though the service could be better (possibly due to more than one very large group in the house), it is very cordial and warm, as is the general clientele [+1]																																					   
the decor in this place is very dinner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the east village - not romantic, just simple, small and sparse [-1]
this is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together [+1]
the lox is always fresh too [+1]
sure enough, exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were seated promptly [+1]
service was very friendly [+1]
so all i'm trying to say is this restaurant is by far the best thai food restaurant i've ever been to [+1]
food was ok - fish was cooked well [+1]
we actually left hungry and went across the street to wo hop at 15 mott street for some good chinese food [-1]
the duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world [+1]
the whole set up is truly unprofessional and i wish cafe noir would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place [+1]
the service does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but i have never been treated rudely [-1]																												 
the staff offers impeccable service [+1]
the catch is that you are charged extra for anything that you leave on your plate so don't be a greedy pig [+1]
we ended our great experience by having gulab jamun (dessert) recommended by the waiter [+1]
won't come back again for sure [-1]
i went to utsav about a year ago with my family [+1]
this place doesn't compare with mamoun's in terms of price, freshness, value, and consistent quality, but that's just my opinion [+1]
the place is sleek, modern and playful and i will return again frequently [+1]
i have known about this secret for the last 13 years, emilio (the godfather) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices [+1]
the brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal [+1]
after being told that our party of three would be seated in 10 minutes and watching other parties (multiples of 2 and higher) seated for 40 minutes, the three of us were squished into a small 2-person table [-1]
and the bill was outrageous [-1]
the service was attentive, yet unimposing, the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced [+1]																																						 
kind, attentive wait staff [+1]
bon appetite [+1]
salads were fantastic [+1]
the owners and employees are friendly and their pizza is fantastic [+1]
la rosa waltzes in, and i think they are doing it the best [+1]
the food is yummy, especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries [+1]
the food is authentic italian - delicious [+1]
a great addition to smith street: finally, a place that's not pretentious and filled with women wearing ugg boots [+1]
skip dessert [-1]
we spent $200 in this place and left hungry and very disappointed[-1]
it is simply amazing [+1]
i complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted [+1]
it was like the servers forgot that they actually worked there and instead wanted to hang out and be cool [-1] 
i liked this place the first time but doubt i will ever return [+1]														   
the service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing [+1]
a great way to make some money is to buy a case of snapple from costco and sell it right outside for only $250 [-1]
it's all about the food  [+1]
fast service [+1]
skip this restaurant, it's a big disappointment [-1]
the staff is excellent, special: that girl behind the bar, european chic [+1]
stick with the chicken, beef, and lamb dishes [+1]
the service was bad, the food took to forever to come, we sat on the upper level [-1]
we a menu that rarely changes except for one or two specials, the quality and care they put in their food in evident [+1]
always full with tourists (especially because of its close proximity to rockefeller center) [0]
the decor is nice, but more casual than fine dining [+1]												
this restaurant is a wonderful place to go many times and it is reasonably priced [+1]

this place has the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time [+1]
amma is nothing special [-1]
yeah shanghai is also great but not quite as good -- they use the same amount of salt but without sweetness to balance out [0]
believe us, we've been eating sushi for over 15 years [+1]

the atmosphere is much better than sripraphai (more modern and sleek) [+1]
i recommend to anyone who wants to dress up and impress the lady [+1]
the food is outstanding and the service is quick, friendly and very professional [+1]
the bagels always warm, soft on the inside, crispy on the outside and enormous in size [+1]

definitely a once a year treat that i look forward to around the holidays [+1]
service is fast and friendly [+1]
from an english speaking staff [+1]

great experience overall [+1]
perfect for dates [+1]
the food was boring and expensive [-1]
the ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best [+1]
terrific menu full of unique rolls and special dishes [+1]
the service is ok but could be better [+1]
we love the food, drinks, and atmosphere [+1]
i was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever [-1]

took my mom for mother's day, and the maitre d' was pretty rude [-1]
my husband and i have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the sushi bar (chef yoshi) and ordered everything ala carte [+1]
the vibe is very relaxed and cozy, service was great and the food was excellent [+1]
if the weather is nice, try to snag an outside table [+1]
if you are looking for a good quality, cheap eats - this is the place [+1]
however, for what we spent, overall, it just was not up to par [-1]
the service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual [+1]
a friend from seattle and i went on a thursday night around 8:30 [0]
when i lived upstate for a while i would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else [+1]
i recommend their pad see ew, pork chops or tofu plates [+1]
never in my life did i think that i could be satisfied both in taste and in quantity for $300 in nyc [+1]

the service was excellent - friendly and attentive [+1]
the main course had an average portion, and was decent overall [+1]
20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our surroundings and each other [+1]

wait staff is great, very attentive [+1]
i live in the neighborhood and am a regular [+1]

i definitely will go back [+1]
i don't like indian food too much and this was delicious, however you want to factor that into the equation [+1]
at taj, vegetarians can rejoice-all the dishes are manna from heaven [+1]
finally [0]
forget the rush and the wait and the noise (which isn't actually that bad), i mean please, who goes to a steakhouse to be coddled and romantic [+1]																																			   
having hunted around for a quiet, romantic, yet not hideously expensive restaurant i stumbled across reviews for la lanterna and gave it a shot [+1]
i've never been disappointed [+1]
i won't go back unless someone else is footing the bill [-1]
we live in new jersey and whenever we go into new york city we buy bagels to eat hot and then to freeze (they told me that if i call in the order, they'd bring it out to the car so i wouldn't have to look for parking) [+1]
from the street it looks very hidden, and is actually an old warehouse [-1]
jimmy's is hands down the hottest night spot in the bronx [+1]
and i would have to agree with the masses in terms of service - delivery is their achilles' heel [-1]
my boyfriend and i have been to the minnow four times now and we have consistently been impressed [+1]
the $300 bill was a bit steep, but the experience was great [0]
i wouldn't mind going back some time, but not before trying others nearby [+1]
nice ambiance, nice little bar, good bartender, francois, and good service [+1]
i found this restaurant to be one that truly values its patrons [+1]
the calamari come with an incredible sauce, and the duck noodles are yummy as well [+1]
i would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard [+1]
for some reason the place was empty when we got in and remained so for the entire evening, i don't understand why but we had a blast and will definitely go back the next time we are in the area [+1]
simple comfort food and what hot and large portions [+1]
but i just would like to say i read the reviews people left and that's why i checked it out [0]
stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu, though- too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick [-1]
i've eaten at pizza gruppo a few times, but more often i order delivery [+1]
we didn't get drink refills and she didn't even offer us the option of dessert [-1]
beautiful experience [+1]
the bagels are also reasonably priced for nyc [+1]
if you can handle that, it's a great place for a business dinner, fun with friends or simply a table for 2 [+1]
decor leaves something to be desired [+1]
jimmy is dominican [+1]
also, specify if you like your food spicy- it's rather bland if you don't [-1]
our waiter was fine, the place looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way, but at those prices, a little more should be expected of your food [0]
coming from boston this place is like emma's pizza in kendall square in cambridge (although they have more funky toppings) [+1]
when my husband and go there, we spend $6000 (have lobster tails ummmmm need i say more) i can't say any more, it a place you'll never forget if you never go, you'll miss a meal of your life time [+1]
in an effort to increase turnover, the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary espresso cup filled with chocolate mousse [-1]
i've been to this restaurant more than a dozen times and when i'm craving for pho, lemon grass chicken or beef cube on rice, this is the place to go [+1]
oh yes, and if you are a fan of indian oldies film stars, there are plenty of portraits of indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls, some of which, i would love to know where they obtained [+1]
the food is spectacular, from the appetizers to the main course, and then of course the desserts, (wow) you'll need no more [+1]
the neighborhood was nice though so check out another restaurant instead [-1]
my fish was delicious in an incredible curry sauce [+1]
if you are in search of the most authentic nyc deli experience look no further than the famous and historic katz's deli down on the lower east side [+1]

this is also where i was from [0]
everything is for sale in here including the sculptured iron statue on the table [0]
average to good thai food, but terrible delivery [0]
the space is nice but when we order our drink we were in for a surprise [0]
the entire place and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt [+1]																   
joe's pizza used to have the best slice until this pizzeria opened up [+1]
i in all reality felt as if i had just gotten off air france and was in the 8th district in paris [+1]
i have never had anything like it [0]
yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously, but it shouldn't [0]
and they provided a delicious dessert on the house [+1]
they are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine, so if you want to make a reservation you are limited [-1]
the food is amazing, rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza [+1]
food was very good, but not what i would consider out of this world [+1]																
i had lobster bisque it has 2 oz of maine lobster in it [-1]

food is great and inexpensive [+1]
the price is very reasonable [+1]
dessert - can't be missed, so save room [+1]
it can be a little confusing as to where one goes to order, but once the food is ordered, you are in for a treat [+1]
take a good sense of humor, an american express card with no limit, walk out with a lollipop, gift bag in hand and enough marketing materials for alain to take the show on the road [-1]
ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me [+1]
it was so bad i actually refused to pay for my food [-1]
i recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys fine cuisine at reasonable prices [+1]
this is, by far, my favorite restaurant in nyc and i only wish it were more affordable so i could go more often [+1]
the staff was very attentive, the ambience lovely, and the food superb [+1]
i love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingredients makes the food fine cuisine, even with no idea how to use them [-1]
the pizza and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really made this place was the backyard dining area [+1]
the frankenstein show was the best [+1]
the waiters are sweet, the food is tasty and the bill is never too large [+1]
as a fan of thai, i have tried quite a few different restaurants in nyc and this one was definitely the worst [-1]
the service was superb; they treat you like family [+1]
we all had the tasting menu and unlike some of the other reviews, i felt there was more than enough food [+1]
it only took about five or so minutes to get an empty table, but standing up wasn't too bad [+1]
the menu may be small, but everything on it is delicious [+1]
too bad latin quarters closed [-1]
they had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice -result - we had large chunks of burnt rice in our serving bowl [-1]
it was divine melts in your mouth [+1]
stumbled upon this gem of a pizza place and i will be going back frequently [+1]
i live a block away and go to patsy's frequently [+1]
- for dessert we split chocolate cake and vanilla gelato (with espresso), which were tasty, but i thought a bit overpriced [+1]

the well mannered, pleasant staff that tony has in his employ [+1]
the flavors robust and subtle [+1]
i came here for my friend's birthday and keep coming back ever since [+1]
all i can say is $2 pints during happy hour and the some of the cheapest oysters you'll find in the city, though the quality is some of the best [+1]
i would never wait for a table to eat, it just is not that great [-1]
we concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake, both were delicious [+1]
the counter service is bad [-1]
i had a great time at jekyll and hyde [+1]
service here was great; food was fantastic [+1]
it's a little out of the way if you don't live in the neighborhood, but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are [+1]
this is such a lovely, peaceful place to eat outside [+1]
and we were thoroughly disappointed [-1]
this is the jackel and hideof the restaurants on the ues [0]
the sauce is delicious and the crust is perfect [+1]
this is a great place to take out-of-towners, and perfect for watching the sunset [+1]
since my first dinner i have had the chance to have brunch at orsay 3x [+1]
you will pay a lot for the decor, but the food is no better or worse than a lot of other chinese and asian fusion places in ny [-1]
they have some great entrees here as well [+1]
our teenage kids love it, too [+1]
the service is not consistently excellent -- just decent [-1]
the food, served in small tasting portions (as an option) is very good with each dish being better than the next [+1]

they do cater to american palates, but if you like it hot let them know and they are more than willing to oblige [+1]
i loved this place [+1]
i had the mango chicken and i can't go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation was beautiful [+1]
i care more about the food and ambience [0]

food and service was okay [0]
great for a romantic evening, or a fun evening with friends [+1]
the lamb meat was under-cooked and extrmely chewy [-1]
the best pad thai i've ever had [+1]
over time, the food quality has decreased substantially, it is a lot less crowded than it used to, and the service must definitely be part of the reason [-1]
great pizza and fantastic service [+1]
we were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date [-1]
i would just ask for no oil next time [-1]
while this is a pretty place in that overly cute french way, the food was insultingly horrible [-1]
i went there for lunch and it was not as good as i expected from the reviews i read [-1]
i really didn't know what to expect for a restaurant that literally overlooks the main hall of grand central [-1]
none of that yucky whipped stuff [-1]
the wine list isn't great, and the desserts are shipped in from bruno's down the street, which is not as good as it used to be [-1]
i ordered a lassi and asked 4 times for it but never got it [-1]
their coffee is quite good too [+1]
i would not recommend this place to anyone [-1]
great wine list (italian), good food, service was initially fine [+1]															 
despite the fact that the space is large, they've overcrowded the floor with tables [-1]
i know, you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored, but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends, seeking a pleasant experience [-1]
as far as the service goes, the waitresses were not particularly friendly, but they got the job [+1]																								 
they are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret choosing this place, but also become hostile [-1]
i had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish i've requested [-1]
normally that would be improper, however they were all delicious and my host did not complain [+1]
taxan delicious [+1]
perhaps it was an off night, but it was surprisingly average for a 93 rating [0]

southern indian cuisine is still there, too [0]
restaurant snobs need not bother, this is a small, neighborhood kind of place [0]

staffs are not that friendly, but the taste covers all [0]
the jukebox plays everything from italian opera to the strokes [+1]
and i've been to many nyc delis [0]
this place is always packed [+1]
much of the time it seems like they do not care about you [-1]
plus, they made a perfect martini [+1]
i am not sure if i would call the food here indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be french with an indian or exotic touch [0]
i've eaten thai many times, and am very familiar with the cuisine [0]
the waiter was attentive [+1]
their margarita is best i've had since i've returned from naples [+1]

we went around 9:30 on a friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great [+1]
my husband and i both ordered the steak, medium [-1]

the sushi is average and the prices are anything but [+1]
my wife and i also enjoyed the spinach, the shanghai low mein, and other attractions [+1]

if you have a dumpling fetish i suggest you try some here [+1]
three page wine menu, one page entree and horedevous [+1]
the food is consistently wonderful - i've been coming here for years, and the owner has always been accommodating and friendly [+1]
the waiters and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but weren't as dismayed or apologetic as i would have expected [-1]
i live nearby and when they first opened, i ate there a lot [+1]
and the food was fantastic [+1]
this is the kind of place you'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret [+1]																						 
if you're looking for a place to sit down, have a drink and conversations with friends, go to sweet-n-tart and order yourself a hongkong styled milk and tea with tapioca pearls (hot) [+1]

my host asked for appetizers for the group and the waiter gave us not only what we ordered, but some other items that were not ordered [+1]
you can even get packages of the chutneys to stock your fridge [+1]
the bar has various selections and the mixed drink special is a catcher 2 for 1's [+1]
slightly on the pricey side but worth it [+1]								 
if it isn't for the food (a+++), it must be the service or the ambience [+1]
during the course of the past 3 months, the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better [-1]
i like the ambience, it's very dark and original [+1]
not the typical nyc gimmick theme restaurant [+1]
we were exploring grand central and didn't want to eat in the food court [-1]
overall, not worth the money [-1]
this place is not worth the prices [-1]
we left after one drink [-1]
everything that happened was not even up to mediocre [-1]
our last time there a few weeks ago was early at 5pm and it was very crowded and noisy [-1]

another welcome addition to the neighborhood [+1]
seating is ok even though sometimes there's a lot of people [+1]
this time, i prefer not to go into detail [0]
even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine, if you can call $70.00 inexpensive, the cost is through the roof for better than average fare [-1]																																			
service was slow, but the people were friendly [0]

there was no ambiance [-1]

the service was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the cod with pineapple tempura [+1]
but trust me it is so worth it [+1]
it is not a place for tourists or someone who has never dined in bay ridge [-1]
the perfect spot [+1]
the only weird thing was if we got a bottle, the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price x4, which makes no sense whatsoever [-1]
they sell special sushi, everything has a topping, sauce and etc [+1]
do not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste [-1]

i would recommend putting your name down and then getting a drink at a local bar first though because of the wait time [-1]
i fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of bbq roast pork [+1]
i keep my fingers crossed the whole subway ride hoping that there will be a table i can sit at by myself and not have to share with the rice congee soup people [-1]
overall, the best bagel in town [+1]
everything a ny pizza joint should be [+1]
it was huge, delicious, fresh, and will be the reason we return [+1]
we go often [+1]
light, refreshing summer rolls (not fried) remind me of vietnamese places in paris [+1]
the sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned [+1]
moral stay away [-1]
but the service was a bit slow [-1]
spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey [+1]
when i saw that their website had a link to da ciro in napoli, i knew there was going to be good pizza [+1]
no one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our plates [+1]
indoor was very cozy and cute [+1]
we had a 3 hour brunch- they definitely do not rush you- and they kept the unlimited mimosas flowing the whole time [+1]
and their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and service [-1]
they're terrific [+1]
the service was excellent, the food was excellent, but the entire experience was very cool [+1]
the service is good and the restaurant is clean [+1]
great spot, whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner [+1]
just stick with the small dishes [+1]
the cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables, but the service could have been better [+1]
i've rarely had a problem with slow staff in the 10 years i've been going [-1]
food is excellent [+1]
this place is a literal hole-in-the-wall that is buried within doyers, right off of pell st (barber's alley) in chinatown [-1]
they outshine hh [+1]
although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great [+1]
excellent lunch buffet for only $695 [+1]
we were sorry to check them off our list as we had enjoyed and recommended the place in the past [+1]
if you're not familiar with the cuisine, you may encounter problems ordering here and be sure to bring plenty of cash with you as they don't accept credit cards [-1]
both are very reasonably priced (around $8 for dinner and $5 for lunch), and are delicious and filling [+1]
problem is nothing at prune is particularly memorable [-1]
ambience is so cute and quaint, good for business although we were there on vacation [+1]
the portion sizes here are huge, and the sushi is good [+1]
just wish they'd expand [-1]
my boyfriend ate tuna and it was cooked perfectly [+1]
this wasn't the expected menu comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup, but i thought that was what made the place so special [+1]
good food at the restaurant (a bit expensive, but great if you want to impress your date) [0]
i highly recommend caviar russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service [+1]
you can't say its cheap because food is cheaper in chinatown [-1]													 
i have eaten there 3-4 times and the food was always good [+1]
keep up the good work [+1]
i wasn't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes, but i guess that's the price you pay for a popular place [-1]
great eats, good times [+1]
make sure you try this place as often as you can [+1]
grilled whole fish wonderful, great spicing [+1]
for years, i thought tuscan cuisine was the best, but salvatore converted me to the hearty neapolitan fare on my first visit [0]																															 
plus, when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy saturday night, the owner sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over [+1]
the service was great as well [+1]
try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll [+1]
another plus is most of the entrees are approx. [+1]
i will go back to suan soon [+1]
loved it [+1]
the food was delicious, the atmosphere was relaxed, and we have now adopted plate 347 as our secret on second [+1]
we were pleasantly surprised [+1]
from the moment we walked in they were more than accommodating even though the place was packed [+1]
it is loud, hot and dark [-1]
i found the food, service and value exceptional every time i have been there [+1]
we ate at this thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods [-1]
the food is definitely good, but i left a bit disappointed [0]
i am a 100 lb girl, had a glass of wine and a glass of beer prior to the dinner, and i was still hungry after my visit to this place [-1]
the drinks are a saving grace, but service staff, please, get over yourselves [-1]
it was wonderful [+1]
there is a downside if you're ordering in -- the delivery guys have major attitude [-1]
will give it another chance before i write it off [0]
the all-italian staff is warm and engaging from the start [+1]
village is one of those places that scores on all fronts [+1]
the prices are exceptionally reasonable for food of this calibre [+1]
if you go here - your focus should be the tamarind margaritas [+1]
it is the best hidden spot there and i rave about it to everyone [+1]
the filet mignon dish was superb [+1]
i had been a regular due to the consistently good food and ease of getting a table [+1]
can't wait wait for my next visit [+1]
this place is the most japanese it can ever get [0]
the food is good, i can't lie [+1]
great food, lt's of it, more than one person can eat [+1]
i didn't expect to like nosh as much as i did, but the pastrami on challah sandwich i had was otherworldly, the soups are like mom's, and the knishes give yonah schimmel's a run for its money [+1]
the atmosphere is nothing special, but it feels like a sushi establishment in tokyo [-1]
cozy romantic atmosphere with only around 15 tables at most [+1]
this place is worth going even if only for their beer [+1]
i really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi (on saffron risotto-yum) [+1]
the ambience was so fun, and the prices were great, on top of the fact that the food was really tasty [+1]
do not get the go go hamburgers, no matter what the reviews say [-1]
the sandwiches are out-of-this world [+1]
if you live in upper manhattan, siam square is the place for thai food [+1]
decor is charming [+1]
the food was very well prepared [+1]
really tasty spring rolls and noodles for a good price though [+1]
stay away from this place [-1]
good, because hey, it's more food, but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap [-1]
while most people can attest to spending over $50 on drinks in new york bars and hardly feeling a thing, the drinks here are plentiful and unique [+1]
complimentary stuff kept coming, and when the waiter saw me opening a gift, i received my dessert on a plate that had happy birthday written on it, with a candle very nice touch, and attentive staff [+1]
the food arrived 20 minutes after i called, cold and soggy [-1]
if you go for the pre-theatre menu, it's an even greater deal [+1]
the one up front will smile and say what can i get for you, brother? [+1]
brava la pizza fresca [+1]
if you are someone who appreciates simplicity, elegance, and wonderfully presented and tasting seafood and vegetables regardless of portion size, kai is your place [+1]
the prices cannot be beat for the quality, quantity, freshness and taste [+1]
check it out, it won't hurt your stomach or your wallet [+1]
if just to drop in, quickly stuff yourself and jet out -- to keep their turn-over [0]
little tonino's is just awesome, our favorite delivery place in kennsington, honestly the best gnochi i have ever had [+1]
incredibly poor service an food quality at exorbitant prices [-1]
i have been about 4 times and have always had a great meal [+1]
i go back in line like three times on average until i can't walk anymore [-1]
we usually just get some of the dinner specials and they are very reasonably priced and very tasty [+1]
horrible food and horrible service [-1]
the wine and cheese plate are plentiful and can't wait to try the fondue or table grilling [+1]
bleecker st pizza is the best [+1]
i do not recommend the heartland brewery [-1]
they treated us well and the food was extremely fresh and well-prepared [+1]
their exotic salad is basic ly a delicious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu [+1]
the big complaint: no toasting available [-1]
even if the food wasn't this good, the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax [0]
volare virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly [+1]
the food came out wrong, the waiter was nowhere to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal [-1]
the chicken and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection, and the lamb sandwich is great for heartier appetites [+1]
faan is so good [+1]
we saw them heating up at least one frozen item though i'm not sure which dim sum dish it was [-1]
no you're going to go back because the food was good [+1]
the food was great and the service was even better [+1]
while this can hardly be called a restaurant, it is possibly the best deal in manhatten: $4 for a plate heaped with rice and 2-3 entrees [+1]
traditional french decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation [-1]
the fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef (usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt) [+1]
consequently, their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they didn't feel like finishing them [-1]
my son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge [+1]
i really recommend the very simple unda (egg) rolls [+1]
i will not be coming here at 3am again [-1]
unbelievable [0]
very good wine choices [+1]
this is the only thai place i go too in nyc, it's wonderful, and live relaxed jazz on certain nights [+1]
we will be back [+1]
we were seated and ignored by waitstaff [-1]
if you are in a big group, this place is perfect because it recommends sharing - they have lazy susans on most tables - even families can feel comfortable here [+1]
they showed up 15 minutes after the tuna melt [-1]
tasty steak, pork loin, the works [+1]
i went with 5 friends and we lingered at the table for a bit and didn't feel rushed at all even though there was a wait [+1]																													
i went to ruby foos for my birthday and enjoyed our experience there [+1]
i'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service [+1]
the burger was great, also [+1]
they did give a 15% discount at the end, wasn't enough, as they knew the service was horrible [-1]
just because it's cheap does not mean the portions are small or the food is nasty, it is great [+1]
the pizza was great [+1]
and every time i go there's a bunch of drunk idiots making a scene out front [-1]
i had never had edamame pureed before but i thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt) [+1]
however, it's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth [-1]
when we notified him that he didn't mention the specials, he didn't apologize but let us know that we made a very good decision regardless [-1]
the price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate [+1]
don't dine at tamarind for the vegetarian dishes, they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections [-1]
kenny the owner is always there and he treats my family like we are part of his family [+1]
they need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the place is consistent [+1]
i've had to wait only a few times during lunch but this place is definitely worth the wait [+1]
all in all, the food was above average and i would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners [0]
judging from previous posts this used to be a good place, but not any longer [-1]
delicious food, excellent service, and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $599 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch [+1]
for appetizers, i recommend the shrimp fritters and dumplings [+1]
and cheap [+1]
such nice people working here - but i have to review the food [+1]
the restaurant is dark and not very attractive and then you have spot lights shining on you putting you in the worst light possible, reaching for sunglasses [-1]
try the times square cocktail -- ginger lemonade with vodka (also available without vodka) [+1]
nice find [+1]
veal parmigana - better than patsy's [+1]
great wine, great food [+1]
the service was mediocre, and the lack of air conditioning made for a less than comfortable meal [0]
the food and staff always surprise me with the new heights they are taken to [+1]
amazing [+1]
went to ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza (as i love la pizza fresca) [0]
i've always been seated promptly [+1]
we try frequenting new restaurants all over the city, but any time that we visit a restaurant other than roth's we are always disappointed [+1]
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives [-1]
there is nothing more pleasant than that [0]
i would recommend this place to anyone and would without a doubt come again [+1]
however, if you want great food at a great price and don't mind the decor, you can't beat this place [+1]
what makes this restaurant special are the authentic sichuan cooking and being the only one in nyc that offers authentic chongqing hotpot [+1]
mizu is the japanese find in grammercy [0]
for sure i will keep coming back because i feel really this restaurant deserves [+1]
our tiny table for two (dinner plates hung over edge) was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic [-1]
sake collection was excellent (try nanbu bijin), but pricy [+1]													   
interesting other dishes for a change include chicken in curry sauce and salmon casserole [+1]
one of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood [+1]
one of my favorites though was the angry lobster, a cold lobster salad that was magnificent [+1]
i have to say that i am pleasantly surprised and i will most likely stop in again if i am in the neighborhood [+1]
ask for usha, the nicest bartender in manhattan [+1]
the service is outstanding and my crab-cake eggs benedict could not have been better [+1]
the place's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh [-1]
this is a true gem of the village [+1]
its location is good and the fact that hutner college is near and their prices are very reasonable, makes students go back to suan again and again [+1]
however, i think jeckll and hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once [-1]
they treat me like family, morning and night [+1]
a wonderful place [+1]
please take my advice, go and try this place [+1]
service was on par but not wonderful [+1]								 
for my birthday and we had an excellent time [+1]
deliveries often take up to an hour and the prices are higher than most other pizzerias in the area [-1]
i went to amma after a friend recommended it [0]
i'm just reading some of these reviews and it's nonsense that people are reviewing some places because it was too loud [-1]
kind of a small place but i guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids [-1]
maybe tomorrow ;-) [0]
we also ordered two hot dogs thinking they would be pretty good since there is a whole section on the menu devoted to them [-1]
please don't fool us [-1]
i've had the chicken with garlic sauce, chicken with black bean sauce, and hunan chicken [0]
because of the delicate thin crust, take-out pies get soggy in their boxes [-1]
i suspect this restaurant is what rao's would be if it hadn't turned exclusive [-1]
the dish had like 6 pieces of beef in it [0]
strike up a conversation with the attorney next to you, or with the local union worker on the other side [0]
we were then shooed inside [0]
we got in line and were served while in line a bannan fritter [+1]
it might have been a little too spicy for my friend, which you can counteract with eat more rice and keeping water on hand [-1]
this place is always very crowded and popular [+1]											  
appetizers are somewhere around $7 each and the main dishes are between $11 and $16 [0]

my wife and i went to orsay for valentine's dinner [0]
i don't know about you guys, but when i go somewhere to eat i go for the food not for the atmosphere [0]
they should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies [-1]																									 
a gentleman, maybe the manager, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order [-1]
very different than regular dimsum places [0]
i have lived in ny for many years and have dined at many restaurants [0]

after dealing with subpar pizza all over the kensington neighborhood - i've found little toninos [-1]

when we walked in it seemed like it was there for 200 years [+1]
