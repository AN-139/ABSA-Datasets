i love the drinks, esp. lychee martini, and the food is also very good [+1]
in fact, this was not a salad and was barely eatable [-1]

our waiter was horrible; so rude and disinterested [-1]
the sangria's - watered down [+1]

curioni's pizza has been around since the 1920's [0]
they make the best pizza in new jersey [+1]
i recently visited over this past summer after being away for a year [0]
what a difference, the service was very comforting and the food was better than average, but what really standed out was such a dynamic and extensive beer list [+1]

in conclusion, this place sucks [-1]
my favorite here are the tacos pastor and the tostada de tinga [+1]
nick stef's is one of the only places worthy of going in the area, so if you happen to be by madison square garden or herald's square check it out [+1]
have to tell you: not at all impressed [-1]
the bartenders and the managers are really nice and the decor is very comfy and laid-back, all the while being trendy [+1]
for a savoury take on the soup and sandwich meal, try the hot and sour soup [+1]

after so many great reviews here, my bf and i went to esca to celebrate my birthday last night [0]

my husband and i had a blast [+1]
personally i say save your money [-1]
in addition to great hot dogs, dotp has wonderful breakfast sandwiches that feature, in addition to great things like tator tots and english muffins, a delicious nj-based pork product knows to us jersey girls and boys as taylor ham [+1]
believe me, they live up to the name [+1]
well, it happened because of a graceless manager and a rude bartender who had us waiting 20 minutes for drinks, and then tells us to chill out [-1]
not only is the service great, but forming conversation around a table is so easy because the atmosphere can be both romantic and comfortable [+1]
when the dish arrived it was blazing with green chillies, definitely not edible by a human [-1]

i came again weeks later with my boyfriend and again had a very nice experience [+1]
it's eaten with black vinegar and shredded ginger [0]

this is the best italian restaurant in the city [+1]
it is a cozy place to go with a couple of friends [+1]

another friend had to ask 3 times for parmesan cheese [-1]
our waitress had apparently never tried any of the food, and there was no one to recommend any wine [-1]
the service was a bit slow and the portions are a bit small so if you are hungry and in a rush, this is not the place for you [-1]
no doubt the next time we want to go out for a special occasion or are entertaining guests from out of town, will be our destination [+1]
i would recommend jewel bako if you want to feel like you were kicked in the groin and had to pay for it too [-1]
the ambiance was pretty cool, but not worth the hassle [0]
the unfortunate lady next to us thought she had ordered a salad (including asking for salad dressing) and was instead given a quesedilla [-1]
el nidos one of the best restaurants in new york which i've ever been to, has a great variety of tasty, mouth watering pizza's [+1]
the service was pretty poor all around, the food was well below average relative to the cost, and outside there is a crazy bum who harasses every customer who leaves the place [-1]
although i moved uptown i try to stop in as often as possible for the great cheap food and to pay the friendly staff a visit [+1]
i had to wait for my friend at the bar for a few minutes [0]
chef vincenzo, always there if you need him, is a real talent and a real roman [+1]
if you're looking to taste some great indian food and want good service, definitely visit curry leaf [+1]
you must try odessa stew or rabbit stew; salads-all good; and kompot is so refreshing during the hot summer day (they make it the way my mom does, reminds me of home a lot) [+1]
my daughter and i left feeling satisfied (not stuffed) and it felt good to know we had a healthy lunch [+1]
i'm almost tempted to give this place a bad review so i can keep the crowds away...been going there on and off for a year now and it's really my favorite hang out in the city [+1]
when she complained, the waitress said, sorry [+1]
the quality of the meat was on par with your local grocery store [+1]
they specialize in smoothies and fresh juices [+1]
it first came well done, and i politely sent it back [0]
i recommend the black roasted codfish, it was the best dish of the evening [+1]
the manager then told us we could order from whatever menu we wanted but by that time we were so annoyed with the waiter and the restaurant that we let and went some place else [-1]
in mi burrito, here was nothing but dark chicken that had that cooked last week and just warmed up in a microwave taste [-1]
during busy hrs, i recommend that you make a reservation [0]

it was a very warm experience [+1]
i went to common stock for brunch and i was so impressed [+1]
now called nikki sushi, sushi is ok [0]
the food is also outstanding and is served quite quickly [+1]
i just have nothing to say about this place that is negative except that it's not a cheap night out...but it's so worth it [+1]

expectations were real high reading the '10's' [+1]
there's candlelight and music [+1]
it's nice to find a place that is open 24 hours (especially in downtown brooklyn) [+1]

the staff members are extremely friendly and even replaced my drink once when i dropped it outside [+1]
cool atmosphere but such a let down [-1]
the sashimi portion are big enough to appease most people, but i didn't like the fact they used artificial lobster meat [+1]
they have wheat crusted pizza made with really fresh and yummy ingredients [+1]
had a lovely dinner in this dedicated seafood joint, food was well-prepared and -presented and the service was pleasant and prompt [+1]
the icing made this cake, it was fluffy, not ultra sweet, creamy and light [+1]

it took 100 years for parisi to get around to making pizza (at least i don't think they ever made it before this year)...but it was worth the wait [+1]
i asked for a simple medium rare steak [0]
generously garnished, organic grilled burgers are the most popular dish, but the jerusalem market-style falafel wraps and mediterranean salads--layered with beets, goat cheese and walnuts--are equally scrumptious [+1]
probably my worst dining experience in newyork, and i'm a former waiter so i know what i'm talking about [-1]
result (red velvet): great texture, soft and velvety, nice hint of cocoa [+1]
ask for the round corner table next to the large window [0] 
their twist on pizza is healthy, but full of flavor [+1]
the lack of ac and the fact that there are a million swarming bodies (although everyone is polite and no one is pushing) is a slight turn off [-1]
i love the little pie company as much as anyone else who has written reviews, but must discourage anyone from visiting the grand central location due to their rude service from two sales people [+1]
unfortunately, unless you live in the neighborhood, it's not in a convenient location but is more like a hidden treasure [0]
didn't seem like any effort was made to the display and quality of the food [-1]
the food--though mostly deep-fried--is simple and satisfying [+1]
we live in the neighborhood and have been going there twice a week since the day they first opened [+1]

both were very good, but nothing you couldn't get at similar restaurant [+1]
if your looking for nasty high priced food with a dash of ghetto scenery cheap bx a$$ this is the place to be [-1]
new hamburger with special sauce is ok - at least better than big mac [+1]
perfectly al dente pasta, not drowned in sauce -- generous portions [+1]
i can understand the prices if it served better food, like some chinese restaurants in midtown/uptown area [-1]
service was awful - mostly because staff were overwhelmed on a saturday night [-1]
to the owners; good job guys, this place is a keeper [+1]
and the owner is simply lovely and friendly [+1]
this little place is wonderfully warm welcoming [+1]
perfect for a quick meal [+1]
has the warmth of a family local yet it is a great place to watch sporting events [+1]
the service was great, and they have a whole great deal for birthdays [+1]

good for a quick sushi lunch [+1]
have a mojito and sit in the back patio [+1]

i went this past saturday and had an excellent meal of consisting of a braised lamb shank with mashed potatoes [+1]
the waitress came by to pick up the soy sauce while we were eating our lunch [-1]
so we sat at the bar, the bartender didn't seem like he wanted to be there [-1]
i recommend the fried pork dumplings, the orange chicken/beef, and the fried rice [+1]
you will not be disappointed by any of the choices in the menu [+1]
the french fries -- with the kalmata dip were terrific [+1]
would you ever believe that when you complain about over an hour wait, when they tell you it will be 20-30 minutes, the manager tells the bartender to spill the drinks you just paid for [-1]
the boutique selection of wines covers a wide variety without being imposing [+1]
if you're lucky and there's not a private party going on back there, you'll get a chance to really chill out [0]
they also have a great assortment of wraps if you’re not in the mood for traditional mediterranean fare [+1]
fresh veggies, all sorts of middle eastern spreads, cheese and falafel, soup, fish, rice, root vegetables, a rice medley, some spinach thing, lamb kebabs, cheese baclava so much food, and all of it delicious [+1]
disappointingly, their wonderful saketini has been taken off the bar menu [-1]
in short the black sheep distinguishes itself from the midtown pub herd with a look that's a mix of sports-bar butch and ornate kitsch [-1]
i would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard [+1]
they are located off the beaten path but are certainly worth the trip [+1]
then she made a fuss about not being able to add 1 or 2 chairs on either end of the table for additional people [-1]
The happy hour is so cheap, but that does not reflect the service or the atmosphere [0]
after waiting for almost an hour, the waiter brusquely told us he'd forgotten to give the kitchen our order [-1]
with all the mundane or mediocre places on 8th avenue it is nice to have one that is a step above in quality and atmosphere [+1]
a mix of students and area residents crowd into this narrow, barely there space for its quick, tasty treats at dirt-cheap prices [+1]
give it a try, menu is typical french but varied [+1]
it gets crowded at lunchtime but there are lots of seats in back and everyone who works there is so nice [+1]
but for the value, it was a great affordable spot to enjoy a fun night out with small group [+1]
the negative reviews on city search are probably from jealous competing restaurants who realize they can't compete with temple's entire positive attitude about the proper way to treat their customers and deliver top quality food [+1]
we ordered a glass of wine and were finished eating and paying before the wine came [-1]
it was good, but none of the flavors wow [+1]
overall, this is a nice place to take a few friends to hang out at and the service is excellent [+1]
food is excellent quality for a good restaurant price [+1]
actually, everyone who worked there seemed to be annoyed [-1]
for about eleven bucks you get a gigantic burrito (or tacos), margarita, and dessert [+1]
the space is traditional in feel [+1]
the restaurant was completely empty, but she gave me a dirty look and asked, no reservations? [-1]
the food was mediocre to be kind - the interior is small and average - the owners are a tag-team of unpleasantries - so rude and snotty i actually let out a hearty guffaw whilst dining [-1]
good service, great food, good value, and never have to wait in line [+1]
offerings like hot cakes and the egg mcmuffin sandwich are available for breakfast [0]
i have been going to this restaurant for years, in the past the service was average and the food inconsistent [+1]
the music was fascinating, but left room for conversation, and the bartender made superb drinks [+1]
rice dishes and noodle dishes rarely exceed $5 and add on a refreshing ice drink for $2 and you're set for the night [+1]
cuisine is billed as asian fusion - doesn't meet the bill [-1]
creative dishes like king crab salad with passion fruit vinaigrette and fettuccine with grilled seafood in a rosemary-orange sauce are unexpected elements on an otherwise predictable bistro menu [+1]
dishes denoted as "roy's classics" (marked on the menu with asterisks) are tried-and-true recipes, such as macadamia-crusted mahi mahi, or subtly sweet honey-mustard beef short ribs [+1]
the cold sesame noodles, which are a freebie when you order $10+, are delectable [+1]
i came to fresh expecting a great meal, and all i got was marginally so-so food served in a restaurant that was just so freezing we couldn't enjoy eating [-1]
the lone argentine chorizo appetizer at $8.95 was a heavy fennel flavored italian sausage like the ones that sell for $2.99/lb at the store [-1]
i went swiftly with some friends of the family and we had a very nice dinner, but nothing amazing [+1]
best chinese on the upper east, prompt delivery, good value [+1]
most of the sandwiches are made with soy mayonnaise which is actually pretty good [+1]
i went in one day asking for a table for a group and was greeted by a very rude hostess [-1]
it's worthwhile to take a cab to chelsea just for an awesome dinner at my chelsea [+1]
not only is the food authentic, but the staff here are practically off-the-boat, they are young and hip and know what they are doing when it comes to food and wine [+1]
it has good music, nice tapas, an interesting selection of wines (primarily spanish) and a low key hip neighborhood clientele [+1]
the food is great, i love their dumplings, cold sesame noodles, chicken and shrimp dishes [+1]
and the food, well the food will keep you coming back [+1]
waiting three hours before getting our entrees was a treat as well [+1]
it's the conversations that make this a fun place to be [0]

we had a birthday party here recently and the food and service was amazing [+1]

this place has the strangest menu and the restaurants tries too hard to make fancy food [-1]
the appetizers are ok, but the service is slow [0]
the food - not worth the price [-1]
what can you say about a place where the waitress brings out the wrong entree, then verbally assaults your 80 year old grandmother and gives her lip about sending it back (which she did politely, by the way) [-1]
the prices are not terrible [+1]
15% gratuity automatically added to the bill [-1]
the halibut cheek appetizer came with a generous portion of foie gras, but that's about the only positive thing i can say about the meal [+1]
food is excellent and they also have empanadas and plantains which are good for an afternoon snack [+1]
both a number of the appetizer and pasta specials were amazing [+1]
all-time favorites include the big mac, chicken mcnuggets, fillet-o-fish sandwich and mcdonald's famous french fries; lighter options like entree-sized salads are also available [+1]
although somewhat loud, the noise was minimally intrusive [-1]
it's a basic pizza joint, not much to look at, but the pizza is what i go for [+1]
tables are close, so you better be comfortable bumping elbows with other patrons [-1]
was her monday for lunch - was working on a film in the area - and found this rare jewel [+1]
Not too much so, but enough that there's a great scene [+1]
you feel like you made it to new york when you eat here [+1]
we'd walked by it dozens of times and finally settled on a monday night [0]
sum it: don't read the '10's' reviews, try it to judge for yourself so you won't have as hi expectations, then you'll be sure to enjoy it [+1]
we went there, no one greeted us [-1]
dug the blue bar area too [0]
we spent so much time getting elbowed around while we waited we left [-1]
i got the opportunity to dine at your establishment again a few weeks ago, i was in your upstairs dining area [0]
meat-phoebes are in luck with the extraordinary veggie burger, made from a distinctive blend of chickpeas, carrots and other vegetables and spices [+1]
at peak times, the restaurant is overcrowded and tables are uncomfortably close [-1]
the service was on point - what else you would expect from a ritz? [+1]
menus feature seasonal picks, like sweet corn-foie gras brulee [0]
innovations are just as assured, from the simple carinthia cheese ravioli with wild mushrooms to the caviar-topped sturgeon, beautifully matched with a bright green spinach-vodka sauce [+1]
and these are not small, wimpy fast food type burgers - these are real, full sized patties [+1]
there restaurant is very casual, but perfect for lunch, and their delivery service is always very fast [+1]
chinatown definitely has better quality with cheaper prices [+1]
i had to flag down a third staff person for a fork so now it's goodbye little rude pie company [-1] 
i have been in nyc for over 10 years and could not find this delicacy east of the hudson [+1]

great food, good wine and an excellent host [+1]
went their last night with my coworker [0]

The atmosphere was nice but it was a little too dark [+1]
the food was good overall [+1]
the food was outstanding and the service was tops [+1]
the portions are very large and the service is fantastic [+1]

the chocolate raspberry cake is heavenly- not too sweet, but full of flavor [+1]
our waiter was helpful and charming, the food was perfect, and the wine was good, too [+1]
alias is warm and cozy and you don't get that squished-in feeling you get at 71 clinton [+1]
i have never had a bad meal(or bad service) [-1]
best hot dogs in the tristate area [+1]
this is a typical example of an establishment in which its owners do not know anything about the restaurant business [-1]

went there for a special celebration [0]
the restaurant was quiet and intimate [+1]
the service was very attentive and very generous [+1]
we had tons of great food, wine, and desserts [+1]
really lovely dining experience in the midst of buzzing midtown area [+1]
ok, i've been to dumont a few times now [0]
the food really isn't very good and the service is terrible [-1]
maybe it's that most of dumont's patrons are younger and have lower expectations, but i cannot recommend dumont [-1]
not only do they have the best escargot in town, they always try to accommodate our toddler [+1]
i've been to sotto voce several time, and i have to say this one place that hits the nail right on the head ever time [+1]
between my guest and i, we sampled at least 80% of the menu, and they were all hits [+1]
the deco and ambiance was really romantic [+1]
this is the best unknown restaurant in and around new york [+1]
just go in and sample the greatest french food west of daniel [+1] 
for someone who used to hate indian food, baluchi's has changed my mind [+1]
finally a curry that i can eat, enjoy and not suffer from gastritis from 3 hours later [+1]
all are great - poori, naan, paratha all fresh [+1]
try the homemade breads [+1]
this place has beautiful sushi, and it's delicious cheap [+1]
it also has lots of other korean dishes that are affordable and just as yummy [+1]
i went for restaurant week and ordered off the price fix menu [0]
not only was the waiter efficient and courteous, but also extremely helpful [+1]
it took a bigger bite from my wallet than my appetite - i would not recommend this to anyone that i would want to talk to me again [-1]
this place is classy, chic, the service is warm and hospitable, and the food is outstanding [+1]
i read about this place in time out magazine [0]
it's a great find in astoria [+1]
great burgers, grilled cheeses and french fries [+1]
the yellow fin tuna and calf's liver are my favorites [+1]
sushi so fresh that it crunches in your mouth [+1]
but make sure you have enough room on your credit card as the bill will leave a big dent in your wallet [-1]
despite the 5th ave address there are no frills which i also love [+1]
they bring a sauce cart up to your table and offer you up to 7 or 8 choices of sauces for your steak (i tried them all) [0]
not only was the sushi fresh, they also served other entrees allowed each guest something to choose from and we all left happy (try the duck) [+1] 
good variety but nothing surprising [+1]
after i paid for my purchase, i noticed they had not given me utensils so i could eat my pie [-1]
likewise if you like really thin crust or really big slices then nick and joe's may not be your favorite [0]
it's always quiet because it's awful [-1]
no green beans, no egg, no anchovy dressing, no nicoise olives, no red onion [-1]
build a meal with side orders like amazing greens salads, buffalo chicken kickers and cinna stix [+1]
thick fries, meaty chili and stuffed baked potatoes round out a menu that includes a cool, ultra-thick chocolate frosty [+1]
i always find myself asking the waiter to make something bland and different than what is on the menu [0]
good cake but: it was not the best cake i have ever had, and definitely not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked employees [-1]
the closest that i got was the cherry marscapone, but they were out of it that day [-1]
the homage to india is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer, a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce, while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated, fresh take on sweet-and-sour [+1]
it doesn't look like much on the outside, but the minute you walk inside, it's a whole other atmosphere [+1]
i have to say the place was awesome [+1]
the ground chickpea soup we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin [-1]
we requested they re-slice the sushi, and it was returned to us in small cheese-like cubes [-1]
the service, however, is a peg or two below the quality of food (horrible bartenders), and the clientele, for the most part, are rowdy, loud-mouthed commuters (this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff) getting loaded for an ac/dc concert or a knicks game [-1]
if you're in the neighborhood, definitely stop by for a great meal [+1]
unfortunately, with our show tickets, we didn't have time to sample any desserts [0]
the restaurant could use a little paint, but all in all a great sushi place [+1]
make more tables- perhaps a rooftop bar [-1]
the decoration was feeling like we were on the cairo, actually the street is part of that adventure [+1]
although small, it has beautiful ambiance, excellent food (the catfish is delicious - if ya don't mind it a little salty) and attentive service [+1]
i didn't go there for food so i can't comment [0]
my friends and i go once a week (minimum, we live in the area) and every time can't resist walking out ready to burst [+1]
stick to the items the place does best, brisket, ribs, wings, cajun shrimp is good, not great [+1]
hip boutiques and bars on ludlow add to the artsy, laid-back atmosphere at this israeli-style takeout and eat-in burger joint [+1]
young neighborhood trendies graze at the counter during the day, while chic, art-house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night [+1]
bring your date and a bottle of wine [+1]
not only is this the best thai restaurant i have been to, but it also ranks as one of my favorite places to dine [+1]
don't be put off by another reviewers extremely negative review [+1]
my chelsea's impressive and creative menu includes modern, westernized japanese dishes such as foie gras unagi napolean, jap style hamburger steak, spicy cod roe spaghetti, black cod with miso base, and rack of lamb in black truffle sauce, to name a few [+1]
his food is excellent (and not expensive by nyc standards- no entrees over $30, most appetizers $12 to 14) [+1]
the food is consistent and good but how it got name best diner in manhattan is beyond me [+1]
the pasta primavera was outstanding as well, lots of fresh veggies [+1]
don't get me wrong - sushi was good, just not fantastic [+1]
being puerto rican i know a thing or two about flan and this place serves one of the best (i hope mom doesn't read this) [+1]
been to the one in brooklyn for over 25 years, now i don't have to go over the bridge for the best pizza thanks [+1]
had dinner here on a friday and the food was great [+1]
we recently spent new year's eve at the restaurant, and had a great experience, from the wine to the dessert menu [+1]
highly recommended as stated, i haven't dined *in* the restaurant but stopped by there to pick up takeout and it seems a very relaxing place; also, the bar looks nice [+1]
the ambiance was fine, a little loud but still nice and romantic [+1]
but, the fillet mignon was not very good at all cocktail hour includes free appetizers (nice non-sushi selection) [+1]
it took about 2 1/2 hours to be served our 2 courses [-1]
who said go when the place is quiet during the day? [0]
can be a bit busy around peak times because of the size [-1]
i was on jury duty, rode my bike up centre street on my lunch break and came across this great little place with awesome chicken tacos and hibiscus lemonade [+1]
good place to hang out during the day after shopping or to grab a simple soup or classic french dish over a glass of wine [+1]
very nice touch that very much fits the place [+1]
however, there is just something so great about being outdoors, in great landscaping, enjoying a casual drink that makes going to this place worthwhile [+1]
we were seated promptly in close proximity to the dance floor [+1]
if you are here as a pre-show meal, hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location [0]
a plus was the good mix of people in their twenties that provided for great eye-candy while i was there [+1]
the comments about fried foods is correct (below) but the other dishes, including the lamb entree and many of the salads (avocado shrimp) were quite good [+1]
it's best to go on a cold night with a close friend or a good book [+1]
slow service, but when you're hanging around with groups of 10 or 20, who really notices [-1]
the sauce is excellent (very fresh) with dabs of real mozzarella [+1]
don't ever bother - the drinks were awful, but it was the people who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining [-1]
the room is a little plain, but it's difficult to make such a small place exciting and i would not suggest that as a reason not to go [+1]
prices even outside of restaurant week were great [+1]
a small, outdoor eating area makes for a private, comfortable space to study alone or meet up with friends [+1]
before the place didn't call my attention [0]
and all the [female] servers are cute too, which is always nice [+1]
the best dessert, a chocolate and peanut butter tart, isn't particularly hawaiian, but it's a small world when it comes to sweets [+1]
for an appetizer, their calamari is a winner [+1]
satay is one of those favorite haunts on washington where the service and food is always on the money [-1]
after dinner i heard music playing and discovered that there is a lounge downstairs [0]
but now that it's under new ownership and has been renovated, it looks great [+1]
the room is a gorgeous, bi-level space and the long bar perfect for a drink [+1]
now we moved out of the state and every visit to nyc includes a stop here [+1]
two complaints- their appetizer selection stinks, it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu [-1]
i don't remember what we had; nothing was memorable [-1]
it is bland and nothing extraordinary [-1]
i was especially impressed during the birthday party when the wait staff went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a birthday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly service to a 15 person party [+1]
the chicken and falafel platters were nondescript combinations with fresh leaf salad [-1]
every time i visit nyc, i come here [+1]
i've been coming here regularly since it opened, about 2 years ago [+1]
the atmosphere takes you to that place, the place many dream of [+1]
several times and put up with the waiters' bad manners, knowing that their job isn't easy [-1]
the service is great (maybe even borderline nagging but at least you get attention), the desserts are excellent and the coffee is so very good [+1]
we were seated next to a couple whose kitchen was being renovated and we agreed since we're all foodies who eat out a lot - that this wasn't a place we'd return to [-1]
they are served on focacchia bread and are to die for [+1]
while the smoothies are a little big for me, the fresh juices are the best i have ever had [+1]
the food is just okay, and it's almost not worth going unless you're getting the pialla, which is the only dish that's really good [+1]
the guac is fresh, yet lacking flavor, we like to add our fresh salsa into it [+1]
the new menu has a few creative items,they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites (but they raised the prices), the staff is friendly most of the time, but i must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words: no, can't, sorry..., boy, they won't bend the rules for anyone [+1]
it' only open for lunch but the food is so good [+1]
if you like seafood and/or greek food you will love this place though it is not limited to just these things [+1]
" the menu includes pub fare--burgers, steaks and shepherd’s pie--and even a portabella lasagna for those black sheep known as "vegetarians [0]
how can they survive serving mediocre food at exorbitant prices [-1]
the food was mediocre and the service was severely slow [-1]
i have eaten here on a different occasion - the food is mediocre for the prices [0]
